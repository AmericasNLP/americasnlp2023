## Parallel data

There are three sources for Spanish (es) - Shipibo-Konibo (shp) parallel data:

1. Flashcards: A sample from the Tatoeba dataset translated into Shipibo-Konibo
2. Educational: Translated sentences from books for bilingual education
3. Dictionary: SIL dictionary entries and examples (https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/30143)

The three datasets are concatenated (in the specified order) in ```train.es``` and ```train.shp```.
