The sudden death of Bolivian hip-hop artist Abraham Bojorquez was especially hard on residents of El Alto, the city from which he hailed.
A victim of a traffic accident involving a bus, Bojorquez left behind many fans around the world, but also left behind a legacy filled with memories and lyrics that reflected on the struggles and the hopes of a young city that has been through so much.
Many Bolivian bloggers knew him well and in the weeks following his death shared their condolences and stories of how much they respected this artist.

A blogger from El Alto, Alberto Medrano of Letras Alteñas remembers the first time he saw Bojorquez perform in Rio Seco in El Alto and how "many young people were left impressed with his cadenced rhythm of" Hip Hop "with an Andean flavor and with content of political protest and revolution, calling for justice for the bloody events of" October 2003. "
The events of October 2003 played prominently in the lyrics of Bojorquez.
During that difficult time in El Alto, approximately 70 residents died during a conflict with the Armed Forces.
The events have since become a rallying cry for those demanding justice.
In the early 1990s, Bojorquez emigrated to Brazil where he worked in a textile factory, but at the same time was introduced to hip hop.
When he returned to El Alto, he started the group Ukamau y Ké and often rapped in the native indigenous language of Aymara.
According to Cristina Quisbert of Bolivia Indigena, Bojorquez had "a particular style of combining hip hop with social order content and with valuing the Aymara culture, and won a place amongst the Alteño youth and in the places where he took his music and song."
However, it was the coverage by the blog La Mala Palabra that provides much of the follow-up after his death and the subsequent displays of homage and remembrance by many who knew Bojorquez.
The blog publishes pictures of the wake and funeral that show the outpouring of sympathy from those that knew him well, and those that simply admired his work.
On the first day of China ’ s school term (1 September), Guangzhou ’ s Southern Metropolitan Daily interviewed some primary one kids about their life-goals.
One of them told the journalist that her dream was to “become an official ”. When the journalist asked what kind of official she wanted to be, she replied that she wanted to“ become a corrupt official.
Corrupt officials have a lot of good stuff. ”
The video is now in the youtube, the face of the girl has been blurred:
This reply made its rounds on Chinese media and blogs.
Some think that it is just a random comment by a child, but many hold the view that it is a reflection of the society ’ s reality.
White habits of ownership of Native Americans generally have not been eliminated; they have only changed the form of their expression.
They were killed by disease and bullets and much worse. They greeted the settlers in friendship and were ground under by the tide of Europeans that moved in. But you know what?
When a race is less advanced than another, they will be defeated, simple as that.
This is Social Darwinism and it is racist (on top of being a discounted social theory not considered by most social scientists as valid). In a similar vein, Kate from the group blog Irene's Daughters, belonging to three women whose aim is to discuss race relations openly, addresses the common practise of schools and sports teams to misappropriate Native Americans names, cultural images and symbols as their mascots. In her post "Racist Mascots", she explains:
(Studies have shown that Indian mascots are especially damaging to the self-esteem of Native American children.) Kate also includes a link to a video aptly titled "I am not a mascot", where several Native Americans voice their concerns and opposition to the use of Native American imagery in sporting events. This 3-minute video, released in different formats, is another evidence of the increasing trend within Native American communities to use online citizen media to fight racism and stereotypes, in much the same way that indigenous communities elsewhere have used ICTs to spread indigenous knowledge and educate the world about their traditions and history.
The purpose and function of university education has been a highly debatable topic both in the East and the West.
In China, people strongly believe that education is a route to success and in the past few years, the number of university students has increased rapidly.
However, as the problem of university graduate unemployment keeps elevating since the financial tsunami hit the continent early this year, there are more expectations for the universities to provide practical and vocational training rather than research skill and exploration of knowledge.
This month a heated debate emerged online when the journalism department of Sichuan University decided to cancel the requirement of writing a graduate thesis, or an extensive research essay, for university students to get their degree.
Instead, graduation would be conditioned on the quality of articles and commentaries published by undergraduates on newspapers.
The head of the journalism department explained the decision:
An increase in taxes was approved by the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico to be enforced in 2010, which will include the Special Tax on Products and Services (or IESPS for its initials in Spanish) that will add a 3% tax to Internet and cable services.
A month earlier, as part of the discussions of the IESPS taxes, the Public Tax Administration Secretary, Agustín Cartens, recognized that half of the money spent on telecommunications belonged to 20% of the richest households in the country, according to a story by Mexican magazine Proceso.
However, those low-income families that do use these services at home will be hit harder because of the assumption that the Internet is a luxury only used by those able to afford the service.
With these words, the Mexican electronic community condemned the idea of Internet as luxury and began their protest on Twitter with the hashtag # internetNecesario (“Internet is a Necessity ”) with great urgency because the final debate and vote started on October 20.
The law was passed in the early morning on October 21.

The protest movement displayed the importance of Internet to Mexicans, and received coverage from national television and newspapers, as well as from high-audience blogs, such as Boing Boing.
The Twitter service WhatTheHashtag estimates that the protest has gathered around 35,000 tweets from more than 7,000 participants.
These are some of their comments on Twitter.

Buy Nothing Day 2009 PV by Illcommonz
Did you know that at this very moment many universities throughout Europe are occupied by students?
Thousands of them are sleeping, cooking, debating and partying in their auditoriums to protest against the under-financing of the educational system and the so-called Bologna Process, a European Union education policy.
What is so special about these protests is the fact that they have not been centrally coordinated by student unions but have been organized entirely bottom-up, with the help of online social media.
It all started in Vienna, Austria on October 22, when a small group of students met for a flashmob in the city center to protest, and then headed to University of Vienna where they spontaneously occupied the Auditorium Maximum.
By the time police arrived, the news of the occupation had already circulated on Twitter, mobilizing so many supporters it was impossible to clear the hall.
Unsereuni websiteWithin days, the occupiers - to their own surprise - put in place a remarkable organizational structure: Mobilization and communication was organized via the Twitter "hashtags" # unibrennt and # unsereuni ("university on fire" and "our university").
A 24h webcast from the Auditorium Maximum was put in place.
Organizational tasks from cooking to cleaning were structured via a wiki, and a website communicated with the public.
Twitter, blogs and Facebook (32,400 fans so far) were used to spread the word.
This had two effects:
- For the first time protests of this scale did not need the support of mass media for mobilization.
Within less than a week after the beginning of the protests more than 20,000 demonstrators roamed the streets of Vienna, preceding any mass media coverage.
Media contacts were limited to a bare minimum (which produced much confusion).
Students simply didn ‘ t need the media and since the protests lacked hierarchy, there was a shortage of spokespersons.
- Second, because everyone could follow what was going on inside the Auditorium Maximum (the webcast produced half a million views within one month) it kept the tabloid press from labeling the protesters as rioters or extremists.
Too many people knew it wasn ‘ t true.
The power of opinion-making had shifted.
Soon the protests infected other university cities in Austria and abroad: Today, less than a month and a half after the first protests, almost 100 universities in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Albania, Serbia, France, Italy, Croatia and the Netherlands are occupied or have seen other forms of mass protest.
Gerald Bäck of Bäck Blog, who works in the media observation business, found out that the gross reach of the tweets, i.e. the unique number of followers exposed to them, was 386,860. His analysis shows who the key influencers were, what URLs were most linked to and what hashtags were used most.
In his blog, smime, Michael Schuster who is specialist in semantic analysis, contributed an overview of the "old media" covering the events.
He counted 2,700 articles and identified four trends lasting roughly one week each: "Protests take place", "protests continue", "protests widen", and recently, "ok, enough now."
Luca Hammer of 2-Blog, a student and technical mastermind behind the Viennese web activities, has published a field report of how wikis, Twitter and webcast were used to get things rolling.
It looks like the case of # unibrennt may become an early milestone in the transformation of Austrian politics by the use of online social media.
It has created wide attention - and confusion - among established media and political structures, and created a spirit of empowerment among students and digital leaders.

books by br1dotcom
The mobile library has become a staple in many library systems, bringing books to those who cannot access the libraries themselves.
However, in many places due to bad road conditions or lack of funding, the traditional system of rigging a bus or truck as a library is not possible.
Thus, library carts, donkey libraries and motorcycle libraries have appeared as viable options to bring books to the communities.
The Camel libraries in Kenya take books to schools in the region so children can learn to love reading, and also deliver books to the nomadic communities.
Where there are people who move with the seasons, libraries have to move with them.
In impoverished countries, books are a luxury few can afford.
These mobile camel libraries take story books as well as non-fiction or school books which subscribers can take home for two weeks, after which the camel library returns and they can renew their books or take out new ones.
Following is a video story of a child seeing the camel library arrive, taking out books and then teaching his father numbers from one of the books he takes home:
Japan may be known for the longevity of its people, but the TV programs have a rich and long history as its population.
There are some series that have been on air for more than half a century.
What's interesting is its variety: everything from talk shows, news, and sports to shows on cooking, music, anime and even a program about the Imperial Family.
This article takes a look at Japanese Choju Bangumi (長寿番組), which literally means "long living program".
Definitions for Choju programs range from as young as 10 years or as old as 50.

Oricon, which published a survey-based popularity ranking, defines Choju programs as shows that have aired longer than 10 years.
The various genres of these Choju programs are certainly represented in their top 10 most favorites ranking based on the questionnaire in October, 2009.
Throughout Latin America, free software matters for many countries and people, who have chosen to use these resources for use in their public administration, as well as to find solutions for other challenges.
For example in Cuba, the free software movement has helped with sustainable development. The Ecuadorian government has put forth public policies that have embraced Free Software, similar to what another regional leader in free software and free culture, Brazil. On April 24, 2010, many promoters and users of free software in Latin American celebrated with a party called FLISOL2010, as explained by Leo:
For example, in Antigua, Guatemala, they broke a Piñata to celebrate free software, which was only one of the activities organized by Antigualug, a group of Linux users. Celebrating with Piñatas used with permission, no rights reserved.
Cuba also hosted simultaneous activities in different localities from Havana to Matanzas.
In March 2010, local media exposed the construction plan and on April 2 OCT claimed that the development project does not affect East Lake. However, blogger Yaohaiying pointed out that the so-called artificial fish pond (450 mu) is located at the core part of the scenic area and is clearly defined in the East Lake protection article approved by the State Ministry.
The blogger exposed in details the developmental plan:
Two villages and a fishery have already been evicted and demolished, starting immediately after the lease was signed last December, and a third villager is in the process of eviction.
The chief concern among online critics of the plan was the possible ecological consequences, since water pollution and algae outbreaks have been increasing rapidly throughout China in recent years, rendering half of China ’ s population and two-thirds of China ’ s rural population unable to access safe drinking water, according to some reports. In 2007 an algae outbreak (attributed largely to synthetic fertilizers) in Tai lake on China ’ s east coast rendered the water undrinkable by two million people in Wuxi.
In Wuhan, critics of the East Lake development plan also point to the plight of another local lake, Tangsun.
On the 1-to-5 scale of water quality, Tangsun went from 1 to 4 within a decade of development, and experts estimate that even the most concerted effort to reverse the lake ’ s pollution would take at least another decade just to restore it to level 3. Finally, critics are concerned about gentrification, as the development plan would transform the lake and its environs from a peaceful, clean place where anyone can enjoy the natural world for free (or a small entrance fee for some of the parks) to an expensive, noisy and artificial resort for the rich.
In this sense some commentators emphasize that the effort to protect East Lake differs from recent comparable protests in China since its goal is not to protect private property or relocate environmental pollution farther away from the city, but to prevent public property from privatization.
More than 200 netizens self-organized via douban event page for strolling against the construction project in late March:

The cost for obtaining a country-specific internet domain has been seen as relatively too high for Bolivians. In comparison to many of its regional neighbors, where Chileans can purchase a ".cl" domain for US $40 for 2 years and where Argentinians can even acquire an "com.ar" domain for free, the price in Bolivia is out of reach for many local residents.
Recently, the Network Information Center of Bolivia (NIC) announced that they dropped the price for the purchase of a ".bo" domain name by 35% The price now stands at approximately $US140 per year. However, there are options to purchase the domain "com.bo" for approximately $US40 per year.
The price reduction was also announced on NIC's newly created Facebook Page, which also opened up the opportunity for users to voice their opinion on the costs of domains.
On the discussion board, Esteban Lima wrote:
Using their blogs, mobile phones, and new media, Egyptian activists have exposed numerous torture incidents by police officers over the past few years.

The most famous incident is that of Emad El Kebir, who was tortured and sodomized by Islam Nabih and Reda Fathi - the police officers who were brought to justice after the torture video went viral.
And the most recent of which is the severe torture and brutal murder of Khaled Said - a 28-year-old Egyptian from the coastal city of Alexandria who died for asking for a search warrant. Amr Gharbeia's most recent post is entitled: Standing in the face of torture.
The most recent torture incident that took the life of Khaled Said rekindled activism against torture, placing it among the leading factors that discourage people from claiming their rights to a better life.

Perhaps the defining sights to date of the 2010 World Cup have been the sparkling new stadiums or the colorful costumes worn by fans of each of the 32 competing nations. Without a doubt, the defining sound of the tournament has been the droning sound of the vuvuzela, which can be heard by spectators attending the games or by the television viewer.
The notable sound has sparked a debate whether the vuvuzela adds or takes away from the World Cup experience.
For local South African football fans, the vuvuzela has been a natural part of the conduct of watching a match, and wonder what is the fuss.
However, for international visitors and viewers the sound of the plastic instrument has been a novelty.
Photo of Vuvuzela at Soccer City by alvez and used under a Creative Commons license.
This debate dates back to the 2009 Confederations Cup held in South Africa, which may have been the first exposure to the sound for many global football fans. Some called for the vuvuzela to be banned from the stadium by those who said that it took away from the enjoyment of the game. FIFA President Sepp Blatter, however, gave his full backing to allowing the use of vuvuzelas at the 2010 World Cup.
He said, "we should not try to europeanise an African World Cup."
Now, just days into the tournament, it has become a topic on the internet by those who complain about it, as well as those who defend the instrument, and even by those who criticize those grumbling about the vuvuzela.
Even though there are some reports that FIFA may look into restricting the vuvuzela due to television complaints, many feel that it will continue on.
Syrian twitterer Anas Qtiesh compares the sound to that of a swarm of insects and writes, "we need to fumigate the stadium, the bee situation is getting out of hand."
Several Twitter accounts are appearing to encourage more complaints about the vuvuzela: @ stopvuvuzela, @ vuvuneela, and @ vuvunee.
The criticism about the buzzing sound of the vuvuzela proved to be quite humorous for some, who turned around to make light of their complaints.

Homemade shrines; boxes of glass or wood, wicker baskets and even cardboard boxes are used to carry the ñatita or the little skull to the main cemetery of the Bolivian capital, La Paz, on November 8 every year.
Human skulls of all ages, from children to the elderly, are used in this ancient ceremony.
Even before those carrying the skulls enter the gates of the cemetery, people start to gather round asking them questions, “What ’ s its name? ” they ask someone with a ñatita in their arms.
The names, like the age of the skull, vary: Cipriano, Sebastian, Cirilo, Gonzalo, José, Felipe, Juanita, Teresa.
The ritual is an ancient tradition but has not always been popular, especially during periods when icons were prohibited.

Patricio Contreras, Fabián Muñoz, and José Luis Mansilla, three students from the University of Los Lagos in Chile, studying Political Science and Administration, are traveling 1016 km on foot as a form of protest over the rising cost and lowering quality of Chilean Education.
The walk for public education began in Puerto Mont, Thursday September 30th. The goal is to arrive in Santiago, the capitol of Chile.
Their march is accompanied by excitement and supportive statements throughout the blogosphere and social networks. News of this march is almost nonexistent in Chilean media.
Caminata Santiago, or Destination Santiago in English, (@ destinosantiago) is the name of their Twitter account and it has more than 400 people following it.
Their slogan is "ante la educación de mercado estudiante organizado" (Students Organized Against Market-Based Education).
November 14 marked a milestone in the history of the Andean region as it was 229 years since the indigenous leader Tupak Katari was sacrificed.
Around 1780, a series of riots erupted around the high plateau areas of the Andes, signifying the discontent of the indigenous people.
In 1781, Tupac Katari led a large-scale uprising of the indigenous people laying siege to the city centre of La Paz which, at the time, was occupied by Spanish settlements. This anti-colonial movement symbolised an affront to the established power and as a result, Tupac Katari was captured before being killed.

As a mark of remembrance of the indigenous leader, numerous activities have taken place across local towns and villages. On November 14, the anniversary of the death of Tupac Katari was marked by an event held in the central square of Peñas located within the Batallas suburb of La Paz.
This square is the exact same spot where Tupac Katari had his limbs tied to four horses before they were brutally chopped off in 1781.
During the 2010 Global Voices Summit in Chile, a young girl from Madagascar asked me whether I am really from Japan, the country where she is passionate about everything including language, culture, and especially sushi. I was impressed that she could speak better Japanese than myself despite the fact that I have been living in Japan for two years already. She is Radifera Felana Candy, translator for Global Voices Lingua Malagasy.
Only 15 years old, Candy is probably the youngest member in the Global Voices team.
Her participation in Global Voices has not only improved her language skills, it has also allowed her to promote her country's language, Malagasy.
I interviewed Candy via e-mail about her personal life and her blogging activities: 1.
My dad is also a very active blogger. As long as I don't talk about politics, it's ok, because here in Madagascar, especially during a crisis, politics is a very sensitive topic. 5.
What is your expectation from blogging for yourself and your community? I hope to attract more people to blog, or maybe that I will change the views of some people by sharing my views, especially about blogging. I remember when I told some of my friends about blogging, they said that it's a waste of time.
It is never a waste of time especially if you write something interesting and useful. Through blogging, maybe we will find other bloggers in the world who also share our views, and who can understand and help us in our lives.

He was shot. By the time this post was written, his murderer had not been identified yet.
Demonstrations condemning this event were quickly organized. The most important one took place this Thursday at Plaza de Mayo, a traditional space for protests in Buenos Aires, but there were also several mass meetings in other areas of the city.
Bloggers quickly reacted to the killing of Mariano Ferreyra.

Chilean students made the news due to a walk of over a thousand kilometers that a group of them undertook to protest the quality and costs of education in their country. But recently, a decision from Education officials sparked a debate, when they reduced the number of hours for Social Science classes in order to increase hours for Math and Language.
This was part of an educational reform proposed by President Sebastián Piñera and the Ministry of Education.

In El Quinto Poder, Danae Mlynarz writes about the role of women in Chilean politics, saying that "political parties do not promote the incorporation of women in their boards, and they do not meet the quotas they have established for internal elections or elected positions."

On Global Voices we work with a large volunteer community to publish stories about what is happening in blogs and citizen media around the world.
Below, are some of the stories that have attracted the most attention in 2010 from our readers in English (our Lingua websites in different languages may have other results).
Often the stories that are most popular are the ones that relate to a story that is making major headlines around the world, like the earthquake in Haiti, or the World Cup in South Africa.
Other times, it's something the media isn't talking much about.

"Tired of hearing of all the disasters, mistakes, deliberate wrongdoing and accumulated grief that made up 2010, in Jamaica," Petchary suggests instead that readers welcome the new year by enjoying the present moment: "a green and gold morning with sunlight seeping through the trees."

Today's independence referendum in Sudan has put the country on the radar in the Arabic twitterosphere.
From Saudi Arabia to Palestine, Arab tweeps are discussing Sudan's unity, division and resources.
The referendum is part of the 2005 Naivasha Agreement between the Khartoum central government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army / Movement and may see the division of South Sudan from the rest of the country.
Is this being done for the love of Sudan or as a blessing for the separation? This post is part of our special coverage South Sudan Referendum 2011.

This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011.
Children, fish and even cats, have joined millions of Egyptians in their call for an end to the Mubarak regime.
In this video, from YouTube, a young Egyptian boy leads the chants calling for the ousting of president Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled Egypt for 30 years:
In Tahrir Square, children are also seen in this video chanting for the overthrow of Mubarak, and his regime: On Twitter, Dalia Ziada shares a link to a video showing children in the US, eager to join the protests in Tahrir Square and notes: حسني مبارك خلى أطفال أمريكا تتكلم عربي وتطالب بإسقاطه http: / / t.co / SUppl10 # Egypt # Jan25 # Mubarak # Kids # US Hosni Mubarak has made children in the US speak Arabic and call for his ousting

You don't need to live in Venezuela to notice that ideological differences have divided the country into two different nations. While it is true that every country should have different points of view, political parties and groups for and against the current administration to have a healthy state where important discussions can take place, Venezuela has become a phenomenon which transcends the differences that could be considered "normal" in any other Latin American country today. The only thing these two sides have in common is ironically their president, Hugo Chávez, who on February 2, 2011 celebrated 12 years in power.
This division is tangible on the walls of every street in the country.
At the same time, through social networks the world has witnessed the arguments in what we call society 2.0: Venezuelans have made Twitter their platform to discuss the country's situation and what for one side means 12 years of the government's mistakes, and for the other the revolution's accomplishments. Luis Vicente León (@ luisvicenteleon), director of Datanálisis (Market Research Company), declares:
Wilpert goes on to name the government's advances in the political, economic, and social realms, as well as on the realm of international relations. He also reviews the shortcomings and obstacles the government has faced in these last 12 years.

On January 9, Global Voices shared the concern of many Brazilian citizens who wrote an open letter to President-elect Dilma Rousseff and the new Minister of Culture, Ana de Hollanda.
The letter urged the Minister to maintain the previous government's policy concerning the inclusive public policies regarding Internet, digital culture and authorial rights. Two weeks later, on January 20, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture removed a Creative Commons license from its website.
Creative Commons Brazil immediately opposed the decision of the Ministry on Twitter (@ CC _ BR): Creative Commons Brazil interprets the removal of the # creativecommons license of the Ministry of Culture website as a backpedaling on the support to # digitalculturebr
Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure to maximize digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.

Prominent Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer, also known as Abdulkareem Nabeel Sulaiman, has been set free, tweeps confirmed today.
Kareem, who was with independent film-maker Samir Eshra, were 'kidnapped' by a group of thugs after leaving Tahrir Square on February 7. They were then handed over to military security for having violated the curfew imposed on Egypt, since the January 25 protests started. After spending a day in a local prison, they were sent to an army jail "in the middle of the desert" where they spent the last few days, seeing other prisoners being "water-boarded, beaten with sticks and electrocuted," according to an interview with the blogger on The Daily Beast.
Kareem, who had spent four years in prison for an article he published on his blog, was released last November 15. His previous arrest and trial, for insulting Islam and president Hosni Mubarak, as well as his abuse in prison, drew international condemnation and supporters now fear he may have been arrested again.
His second arrest - and his consequent release, also drew a lot of solidarity and support online.

This post is part of our special coverage South Sudan Referendum 2011. Southern Sudan has officially become Africa's newest nation after Southern Sudanese voted for secession from the north.
Official referendum figures released on Monday showed that 98.83 per cent of voters from the south chose to secede from the north. This is a roundup of reaction to referendum results.

A large crowd of Southern Sudanese gathered at the Mausoleum of Dr. John Garang in Juba to celebrate the announcement of the official preliminary referendum results on Sunday.
The results showed almost unanimous support for secession throughout Southern Sudan.
The colourful occasion was marked with singing, dancing, blowing of horns and beating of drums.
The results, announced by the Chairperson of the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission and his Deputy, were met with thunderous applause from the crowd.
As'ad questions America's double standard: Compare the speed in which the US government has recognized the Southern Sudan state and the treatment of Palestine by the US government.
Law Hawk says that Southern Sudan will need to rely on its northern neighbor:
Still, South Sudan will need to rely on its northern neighbor as the main oil pipeline from the Southern oil fields must travel through Sudan to generate much of the income needed by the country to get off its feet.
How will Southern Sudan attract investors?: In Sudan, or Ex-Sudan; we had lots of politicians..
However said, should refer to benchmarks.. not actions..! Without benchmarking, any action might be called wonderful..!! while it is a slip to hill..!!
I don't mean to question any officials or representatives, but the Bell Syndrome tells that only 2% (on any level) would be able visualize the big picture..
You need to learn all lessons around, to smooth your way forward without glow, fake or deformed interests..
If you would trust a "Darfurese" knowledge-based expert..
Ok, let's meet the facts without those nicely said words..
With almost 80% illiteracy, 0.5% graduates, 0% infrastructure, 50% political unrest and 99% tribal mind-set..
This is not a recipe for IFDs or PPPs, but only for UN / Gov Aid.. Unless you draw your own realistic visions on government (what Singapore did), on Capacity building (i.e, Balkan), on governance (i.e, S Africa); South Sudan will unlikely attract investors..!
They are greedy and cautious..
Kizzie is very jealous of Southern Sudanese:
A good friend of mine said that Northerners are upset about the South Sudan referendum because they are jealous that the Southerners have the chance to vote and every Southern vote makes a difference, we have nothing.
Yes, I have to admit.. I'm very jealous.
I registered to vote in April's elections, but my candidate of choice withdrew from the race and I was left wondering whether my voice would have made a difference in the first place.
Sudanese Optimist is happy for Southern Sudan but...:
Although I am very happy for South Sudan to finally gain their independence from the condescending haters in the North, I am truly sad to see that we ’ ve lost such a vibrant part of ‘ our ’ Sudanese culture.
Perhaps out of watching all the crazy politics lately, the most thing that stuck with me is the Prayer of Saint Francis read yesterday during the secession announcement.
Perhaps it is because I have been in never ending zen state for the past few months, but it just seems that all the political news were noise, and the minute I heard this, I can finally hear humanity speak, not politics … and I sure like that
Lodiong Morris reports that the North and the South have resolved the issue of citizenship status:
According to the Minister, the semi-autonomous Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) and the National Government agreed that those Southerners who wish to remain in the North can become citizens of the North if they so wish.
Northerners in the South can equally be granted Southern citizenship rights if they so choose: “We have agreed that Northerners in the South and Southerners in the North will have their rights respected and be given citizenship if they choose, after the declaration of the results ”.

For many, these storms provide welcome relief from the drought the country has been experiencing. The Sea of Galilee, Israel ’ s main water reservoir, has risen five centimetres as a result of the storms.
This sentiment is echoed by many in the Israeli twitosphere. @ Tekhelet said: I am glad Israel has storm / rain and snow now.
First, it was the wind, very strong and then the sand... When we reached Mitzpe Ramon it was so cold and windy … I was terrified.
The gales of wind kept hitting the car from one side, then the other and I was panic stricken.
And then there were those who threw caution to the wind and took advantage of the stormy conditions. Shahar Zubari, an Israeli windsurfer, braved the weather and headed for the waves.
Serbian daily 'Alo' carries an image of Serbian mercenaries in Libya.
Update (28 February, 2011): Two days after Global Voices published this story, the Serbian Ministry of Defence issued a statement on 25 February, 2011, denying Serbian military involvement to the Libyan civil unrest.
Quoted in Reuters, the Defence Minister said,
According to a Maltese blog Malta CC, Serbian military pilots reportedly took part in the bombing of protesters in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
In the same article, Alo revealed that Serbian mercenaries were allegedly killing protesters in the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi:
Serbian mercenaries earn tens of thousands dollars for this job … They come from Serbia, but Bosnian and Croatian agencies are involved in recruiting for this kind of work … "Serbian legionnaires" are veterans of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In addition to former members of the military and police units, the bulk of these forces are the former … Gaddafi pays them as much as they demand! A good number of them had great-paying jobs in various African countries, but this was an offer not to be rejected.
It can be expected that in the near future a lot of our contractors go with Gaddafi, who has great confidence in Serbian soldiers. It appears that Serbian netizens are not too surprised by these allegations and revelations.
Krstarica forum is one of the venues rich in debate.
In the wars in the former Yugoslavia they cooperated with the Croats, Muslims, why now would not work for Gaddafi.
It doesn't matter to them at all who the boss is.
Sicilian writes: It is OK! Gaddafi has always been on the Serbian side...
It seems that he believes the Serbs most...
Libya has not recognized Kosovo, yet another reason to support Gaddafi.
Neca 1977 asks:
How do I apply for Gaddafi's mercenaries?
Mika Egzekutor observes:
Bosniaks and Croats are today finding jobs for those who were shooting them yesterday.
Paja 1408, a Serbian military officer, recalls:
Hey, gentlemen, what is strange about it?
I know personally, when I was in military schools, there were also Libyans, Iraqis, Zambians, Palestinians...
I know that they were in Russian schools also.
Gaddafi's military experts appreciated the school in Yugoslavia...
Many were coming to help Libyans under special contracts...
Personally, I have had an offer to go there, and I know many colleagues who went...
Visitors on an ultra-right, white power forum "Stormfront" also spoke of the alleged involvement of the Serbian "dogs of war" in Libya.

"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise," wrote Thomas Gray in 1742.
In the age of social networking and online media, sometimes it seems there is nothing but bad news and that there is nothing the ordinary citizen can do.
Most people know the old adage that a lack of knowledge results in happiness, but could it be that it is precisely the opposite, that ignorance causes misery?
The book No somos hormigas ("We Are Not Ants") is a response to widespread negativity and a generalised feeling of disempowerment.
More than a mere book, it is a complete strategy against depression and passivity.
But this is no happy-go-lucky, best-selling, superficial self-help book.
The four young authors from Spain, combining backgrounds in economics, journalism, international development, entrepreneurship, marketing and design, introduce the project like

The title is explained like this:
If we were ants, humanity would be a happy species.
We have colonised the whole planet, our life expectancy is greater than ever before, and our technical achievements are impressive.
Nevertheless, we are aware of the magnitude of the challenges we have yet to face, and of the dangers and injustice that still haunt us.
We are a community and what we are doing we are doing it together, we share a common origin and along Planet Earth we share a common future too.
A future that is up to us to decide.

In December 2010, senators Evelyn Matthei (from the right-wing party Independent Democrat Union) and Fulvio Rossi (from the Socialist Party of Chile) presented a proposal to decriminalize therapeutic abortions, a procedure banned in 1989 during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The proposal allows for a therapeutic abortion if the mother is carrying a nonviable fetus or her life is at risk.
Bloggers have turned to the Internet to discuss the proposal.
In a post with more than 230 comments in the blog Zancada, Anita says that women should not let the State decide on this issue for them:
This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011.
This evening, following the total Internet blackout in Egypt, Google and Twitter (along with SayNow, a company recently acquired by Google) made a timely announcement: that they were jointly launching SpeaktoTweet, a service that would allow Egyptians to call an international number and record a voice message that would then be tweeted from the Twitter account @ speak2tweet. All evening, recordings have been popping up on the Twitter account from Egyptians who have had the chance to learn about the service. Because of the total Internet ban, Egyptians on the ground have presumably learned about the service from phone calls to and from friends and family outside of the country.
@ monasosh is one such user; as her brother @ alaa announced that she had taken advantage of the service.
Her recording, available here, is roughly transcribed as follows:
They did this before, the only difference is the last when time they did this I was completely freaked out; I was so scared that they were going to shoot us all and nobody would know about us.
This time, I ’ m not scared at all, I feel as if, like, I want to tell them ‘ bring it on! ’
We are excited, we are happy, we are going to be in Tahrir Square tomorrow, we are going to be huge, and we are going to do our march and do our protest and Mubarak is going out.
Be with us!
Most of the calls are made anonymously, without the speaker identifying him or herself.
Another call from Egypt, available here, is as follows:
Tomorrow, history will be made.
Tomorrow, we will make history.
Tomorrow, the Mubarak regime will be over.
Tomorrow, we want you out of our country.
Long live Egypt.
Egyptians outside of the country have also taken advantage of the service to have their message heard by the world.
One such user, who self-identifies as Egyptian-American, spoke:
... You are making us so proud, you are making us so so proud in America.
Stay strong, Egyptians, stay strong, we love you here.
This is an Egyptian-American and talking for all of the Egyptian-Americans who emigrated here because of the brutal regime, stand strong: you ’ re making us so proud. Free Egypt.
Their message will be automatically tweeted at @ Speak2Tweet.
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Libya's dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi just gave a furious speech on Libyan State TV today, Tuesday, warning and threatening anti-government protesters and their supporters, that the Libya would end up like Afghanistan, Iraq, or Somalia.
He encouraged Libyans to come out of their homes tomorrow and chase down "the terrorists" and hand them in to security forces so they could be "punished with death".
He said he would keep fighting for Libya till "his last drop of blood" and went on to list in great detail every single thing that would be punished with death, including working for a foreign organization, using force against government forces, or threatening the unity of the country.
The rambling, apparently unscripted speech was followed by Libyans, Arabs, and citizens everywhere on Twitter, and evoked both sarcasm and ridicule, even amidst the tragic circumstances of death and instability in the country.
Gaddafi justified Libya's brutal crackdown on protests in recent days, listing other moments in history when governments have killed protesters, saying things like, "The unity of China, was more important that those on Tianamen Square."
Tomorrow, he said, youth (those not "on drugs") should form committees to defend his revolution.
"You are more than them," he said.
In the wait leading up to his speech, tweeple humorously guessed why he was late in giving his anticipated speech.
@ acarvin: Gaddafi: raise your heads for revolution, for battles of liberation.

Optimism prevailed among the politicians and other officials attending, as demonstrated by Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the COP 16, who stated the following at the closing ceremony: "Cancun has done its job.
Ordinary citizens and Bolivia, the only country that did not vote for the final text, are not so certain. The blog of the Togolese section of the NGO network Young Volunteers for the Environment, founded in 2001 and operating in 13 countries throughout Africa and in America, contained a virulent article by Séna Alouka. He described the city where he was writing from as being against the COP 16 sessions and their outcome.
They probably went to finish their shopping and rush home.
For most of our English-speaking colleagues, and those in the Climate Action Network (whose mechanism I am now mastering), the majority of the releases were prepared well before the end of the COP..... whatever the final Cancun agreement is, the President ended her speech with such a phrase: "We understand that we are not following our own internal regulations but to save face at Cancun, we are adopting the text." The blog opapilles.hautetfort.com thinks that
Jean-Michel Bélouve wrote an article on his blog reprinted by the site agora.fr called "Conférence climatique de Cancun: l'accord cache le désaccord" (Cancun Climate Conference: The Disagreement Behind the Agreement): We may ask ourselves how the countries that we still call wealthy can agree to pay out such sums ($100 billion, by 2020). The agreement also fails to mention the sources of the financing.
Seen from this perspective, we reach the conclusion that not only was Bolivia right to be opposed, but that it is also the last spokesman for the most radical opponents. This post is part of our special coverage Global Development 2011.
This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet. The Portuguese language, spoken by more than 200 million people around the world, has often been described as the "fatherland" or "motherland" of the Portuguese-speaking world.
On February 21 we commemorated International Mother Language Day, established by UNESCO in 1999.
In a tribute to the Portuguese language in all its linguistic and cultural diversity, we invite you in this article to navigate through reflections from Portuguese-speaking bloggers, prompted by their reading of the first novel dedicated to the Portuguese language, Milagrário Pessoal - the most recent work by the Angolan author José Eduardo Agualusa.
The title of this article was taken from the blog Mértola, in which Carlos Viegas writes that Milagrário Pessoal is:

A number of secondary (high) schools broke out into anti-government protests across Bahrain on Tuesday March 1.
Both boys' and girls' schools in Isa Town, Hamad Town and Jidhafs marched out of their schools in the middle of the school day in support of protesters camping at Pearl (Lulu) Roundabout.
Schools in Isa Town headed towards the Ministry of Education demanding the resignation of the education minister and venting their anger on the volunteer teachers' scheme put in place when teachers went on strike in support of the Pearl Roundabout protesters and the fallen martyrs.

Friday (Feb 25) was officially announced as a 'Day of Mourning' for all the martyrs who have fallen since Bahrain's Day of Wrath protests, which started on February 14th 2011. Blogger Mahmood Al-Yousif reflects on this day of mourning through his latest post:
With respect for human, political and economic rights. For a bilateral constitution which defines the relationship between the government and the people. For equal opportunities.

One has to admire a person with the wits to keep a video camera turned on while the ground is shaking beneath them.
Citizen videos recorded Friday, March 11 during the earthquake and tsunami that caused mass devastation in many parts of Japan are all over YouTube.
Among the many shared online, here are just a few.
The day of the big quake
Staffers at a supermarket in Tokyo hold up the shelves during a quake that lasted longer than a minute.
As the earthquake shakes a house, the people inside rush to the street.
These people watch a tsunami engulf Iioka Port in Chiba Prefecture from higher ground.
At Shinjuku station in Tokyo, on March 11, these were people who couldn't get home after the quake.
Two days later
After the quake, a man surveyed the damage in Iioka, Chiba Prefecture on March 13th and said: "It's like the wave passed through town."

Critical Mass is an event that takes place in over 300 cities around the world, when tens, hundreds or even thousands of bikers gather in the streets to encourage the use of bicycles as an alternative form of transport to motorized and polluting vehicles.
On every last Friday of the month the city of Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, holds its own critical Mass event, but on February 25, 2011, a tragedy occurred; Guilherme Valadares from the blog Papo de Homem (Man Talk) explains:

The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai
As a response to the situation in Japan after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, people have turned to videos and music as a way to send their best wishes and support to the people of Japan.
In his blog, Tomonori Shiba gathered a few videos from musicians who believed that it was the least they could do, trusting on music's power to heal the wounds of the heart.
This first one is by micromicrophone:
Gifted on West East, located in Seattle, USA wrote a hip hop song about the disaster, urging people to commit and do their best to help. From the song:
Air strikes on Libya, aimed at crippling Muammar Gaddafi's air defenses, just started, receiving mixed reactions from people around the world.
A coalition made up of the US, France, Italy, Canada and the US have been formed for the offensive to uproot Gaddafi, whose people have called for his ousting since popular uprisings started in the country on February 16. Here's the latest buzz from Twitter:
@ alsulaiti: @ MuammarLGaddafi if u ever decide to leave Libya, anytime soon, no pressure, I have a nice place for u here in qtr
@ robcrilly: on roof of hotel. shelling towards the airport now, columns of smoke in the distance.
This post is part of our special coverage Yemen Protests 2011.
March 18 was the bloodiest day since the beginning of the uprising in Yemen, almost two months ago.
Ali Abdullah Saleh called several times for the security forces to protect both pro and anti-government protestors.
However, on the ground none of this happened.
The attack which was intended to bring an end to a series of protests sweeping the country, has increased the compassion with and the support for the protestors.

On Monday, Ali Muhsen, a high official in the Yemeni army declared his support for "for the peaceful revolution of the young people and their demands." Nasser Arrabyee, a Yemeni journalist based in Yemen writes: The military commander of the northern region, Ali Muhsen, declared his support Monday for the peaceful revolution against the 33-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

A 6.8 earthquake hit northeast Myanmar on the evening of Thursday 24 March, 2011, which was felt in nearby Thailand and as far away as Vietnam and China.
The quake killed at least 70 people and destroyed more than 240 buildings in Myanmar alone.
Strong tremors were also recorded in the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in Thailand.
The number of casualties could be higher.
According to reports, more than 80 coffins were sold out in Tachilek on the morning of Friday 25 March.
Observers described the earthquake as the third biggest natural disaster that struck Burma after the 2008 Cyclone Nargis and the 2010 Cyclone Giri.
Independent paper The Irrawaddy interviews residents of Mae Sai in Thailand.
In a letter published by Shan Herald, Jai Noi narrated the impact of the quake on residents
Dear All there we have been alert the whole night, sometimes napping while trying to stay alert.
The Phone is not working properly, both mobile and home phone.
There is no damage done to the house so far.
We stayed in and out of the house all night.
I hope this mail will be able to pass through.
There is big damage in Taler, 40 km north and the bridge was destroyed.
Heard most of the town was flattened and as there is only one doctor there, the injured were sent to Tachileik more than it can accept. About 80 casualties at least.
No detail yet.
There are sure to be damaged.
The centre is around Merng Lain, 59 km north of Maesai as the new has said.
There are still after shocks up to now.
The blog akm-kuntha uploads pictures showing the damage on roads in Tarle, a city 20 miles away from Tarchileik.
Democratic Voice of Burma also uploaded pictures of the quake disaster.
Here are some twitter reactions from Yangon
@ ascmmr: Dear Fans, We wish you well and safe from earthquake.
If you feel the earthquake on 24 Mar 2011 8: 25 pm
@ minnyoonthit: earthquake cause great damage in Northern Shan, Tachileik area (over 100 ppl dead, several ppl are wounded.
@ blacksumo: shitttt the earthquake was real?? i thought my aunt was being delusional...
This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011.
A picture is worth a thousand tweets, especially when Twitter is blocked in Egypt in order to halt the transfer of information about the ongoing demonstrations in Egypt today.
Egyptian blogger, Zeinobia, decided to take her camera and go down to the streets and take some photographs and upload them to her Flickr account.
Here are some of her photographs: In Cairo, tens of thousands of the security forces were seen in the streets since the early morning in their famous black uniform.
This photo is taken by Zeinobia, under creative commons license.
Today is a national holiday in Egypt. The streets were empty.
Yet the security forces had their own plans to control the flow of protesters, especially when the usual traffic jams in Cairo's streets are not there to do the natural control of the flow for them.
The security forces blocked some of the major squares and intersections in Cairo.
Cars were redirected into bridges or tunnels when possible, as it is always harder to demonstrate inside a tunnel, right!?
Some users on twitter reported that the underground metro was closed also to control the flow of the protesters.
This photo is taken by Zeinobia, under creative commons license.
Rassd New Network published a stunning photo of the protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo down town on their Facebook page (Update: This photo appears to be a copyrighted Getty image, visit Washington Post to see).
In the evening, the number of the protesters in El-Tahrir Square became really huge.
Midan El-Tahrir or El-Tahrir Square has been the site for numerous major protests and demonstrations, including in March 2003 when people came out to protest the War in Iraq.
Twitter was reported to be blocked in the afternoon. Before that, some people had the chance to upload photographs to services like twitpic. @ M _ Na7as uploaded the photograph below on his twitpic account showing how the protesters outnumbered the security forces in the city of El-Mahalla.
The protesters surrounding the security forces in El-Mahalla.
It worth mentioning that El-Mahalla has experienced waves of workers strikes in the past few years.
Photo taken by @ M _ Na7as
Also outside Egypt, people recorded the demonstrations with their cameras. @ MafazAlSuwaidan shared the picture below of a protest taking place in Toronto, Canada. Egyptian protesters in down town in Toronto chanting: Revolting till victory, revolting in every street of my country.
And @ alasmari shared a photo of torn pictures of the Egyptian president in one of the billboards on the streets. Meanwhile, Lebanese web developers Layal Al Khatib and Mirelle Raad developed a new photo aggregator to collect photographs shared by netizens for the protests under one roof.
After completing the project, Layal tweeted:

It was more a whisper than a shout: a group of a few hundreds peacefully demanding an end to the 28 year rule of Paul Biya. That group was met by army officers in full riot gear as they walked the streets of Douala, Cameroon ’ s delapidated commercial capital, who first spray the group leader and presidential candidate Kah Walla with the water cannon and as she and the other drenched protesters board the army truck, they are beaten with batons. Up Station Mountain Club reports that members of the group Cameroon Ô'Bosso are being detained:
The gendarmes descended upon them at about 8: 00 a.m. before the protest had begun. The gendarmes arrested our colleagues and seized the 200 t-shirts and 200 water sachets that they were carrying to give out to other protestors. However, one reader says that they might have been released:
Peaceful demonstration barely begins Nasty public beating of the pressure group, again to intimidate the public, but not enough beating to cause fatal injuries The public watches in fear.
But there is not denying from these pictures that the intolerance is the same; that the dictator is hell bent like Gaddafi to die in power; that the local press is pressed to stay quiet or share the government propaganda.
Finally, read a protest diary: Kah Walla, the presidential candidate for Cameroon Ô ’ Bosso, who led yesterday ’ s peaceful protests that was brutally quelled by the army sent this dairy of events leading up to and during the protest and reflects on lessons learned. About 12: 45 p.m.
The Latin Americanist blogs: In 2008 Morales expelled the Drug Enforcement Agency from operating in Bolivia after the U.S. ambassador was accused of plotting to oust him.
A study (publication of this study was banned, but is partially available on the Transnational Institute ’ s website) in 1995 by the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that no negative effects appear through the use of coca leaves; rather, the indigenous Andean population experienced positive effects in their therapeutic, sacred, and social functions. Blogging by boz summaries:
It is nearly impossible to reduce these groups; when you arrest or shut down one, there are ten more ready to pick up the slack.
Juan Arellano gathers several videos from this year's presidential campaign in his blog Globalizado.
On Wednesday April 6, 2011, thousands of Mexicans in various cities throughout the country and some abroad, such as New York, Buenos Aires and Madrid, took to the streets to protest against violence.
Some demanded the resignation of President Felipe Calderón, as they believe his strategy in the fight against crime and drug trafficking has exacerbated the bloodshed, according to reports by the BBC.
The murder of the son of journalist and poet Javier Sicilia, which happened in the state of Morelos at the end of March this year, revived a wave of indignation against violence in Mexico and gave rise to the protest marches.

Citizens ’ reactions quickly appeared in various blogs.
Víctor Hernández, whose opinion appears in the blog Michoacán en Resistencia (Michoacán in Resistance), celebrated the fact that the marches were organised by ordinary citizens and were not the result of a media campaign orchestrated by some political faction:
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights and Global Development 2011. Indigenous communities in Colombia are taking steps to protect their food security.
Not only are they educating their communities to eat what they grow on their vegetable gardens instead of buying expensive food brought from outside but they are also protesting new laws and regulations limiting their access to milk.
Products grown by the indigenous communities
In these next two videos (also in Spanish) we can see the indigenous Misak community who among others marched to the capital city of Bogotá to protest a new law that would make selling raw milk illegal.
In their communities, where they buy milk from neighbors and supplement their diets locally, putting a restriction on raw milk would mean that they would have to buy processed milk at much higher prices, affecting both milk buyers and sellers.
The videos are titled "Milk in Cans doesn't Kill, Hunger Does"
You can follow these and other activities of the indigenous communities in Colombia through their website in Spanish. This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights and Global Development 2011.
This interview is part of our ongoing series of portraits of Global Voices contributors.
Translators are behind-the-scenes contributors who allow readers to read our content in other languages.
Interest in a particular country is often one of the reasons that takes a reader from being just that to become a contributor to Global Voices.
Japan is at the center of Gaël's concerns right now, but it was thanks to his interest in Bangladesh that he first discovered Global Voices.
See here for other portraits of bloggers and translators of Global Voices worldwide.
Global Voices translator Gaël Brassac in Kyoto, in April 2010..
Were you a frequent Global Voices reader before starting to translate into French?
Gael Brassac: I discovered Global Voices in early 2009 at the university, when I was carrying out research on the monitoring of geopolitical strife in Asian countries.
I had heard of a mutiny within the Bangladesh army. Sources of information were quite rare in the press, but on Global Voices I discovered a very good article by contributor Rezwan, which helped me a lot!
Gradually, I began to translate for the site and I also now contribute as an author.
Which Global Voices article that you have translated struck you the most? GB: One of the first that I translated was about Egypt in June 2010, 'My name was Khalid and I was not a terrorist'. It explained why this young Egyptian, who had incriminating videos of the local police, was murdered by those same officers.
The article showed widespread corruption throughout the state of Egypt, all throughout the police force. Less than a year later, everything changed, but demonstrators in Tahrir Square did not forget Khaled, and waved his portrait during the best as well as the worst moments of the Egyptian revolution.
You live in Drôme, France, but Japan is central to your life, especially at this time. Why Japan?
GB: Blame it on the TV series Club Dorothée and its Japanese manga animation when I was a kid!
I wanted to learn the language and live in the country. At first, I studied English and Japanese with the intention to start a business between France and Japan, but the marketing and strategy courses got the better of me. I preferred to engage in something where a commitment to solidarity and human beings were the main concern, not money.
GB: The week after the Japan earthquake, the tsunami and the radiation leaks, I was very stressed.
I actively followed the news but the mass of conflicting information in the traditional media gradually put me off, and in order to be less on the edge, I selected a single source of information, a forum.
When a disaster like this happens in a country where one has so many good memories, a girlfriend, friends, and where one still hopes to live, it is difficult to handle.
But I'm sure that Japan will rise above it as it was able to do so after the Second World War. I hope it will adopt a progressive policy on sustainable energy and take the right decision just as they did when they wrote the article 9 of the Japanese Constitution of 1946 when they renounced war forever.

The day after celebrating the elections in Peru on April 10, the results were clear: there will be a second round, and as of writing this post, in accordance with the official numbers from the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE), with 72.373% of the electoral tickets counted, Keiko Fujimori extends her advantage over Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and will be the rival to Ollanta Humalla, who currently maintains first place with 29.02% of the votes.
Taking into account that the ONPE's report is one of counted votes, not an accurate representation, it remains clear that as the electoral votes that continue arriving from distinct corners of the country proceed to add up, the results for Fujimori and Kuczynski can cross one another's path temporarily; but as the total number of counted votes is determined, it will be unlikely that the expressed tendency in the exit polls (Ollanta Humala in first place, Keiko Fujimori in second, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in third) will change substantially.
Bloggers, candidates, and analysts coincide that this result is principally "an angry vote", a vote of punishment for the economic policies managed by the governments in recent years, that have fomented growth and created a new prosperity that curiously does not sit equally with everyone, but rather has further accentuated the gap between the extremes on the socioeconomic scale.
Roger Merino explains it clearly in his blog Comparación Jurídica y Análisis Crítico:
Pablo Andrés Rivero blogs about a "collective, ritual meal of the Andean region" he shared with Aymara women in the Palca municipality, close to La Paz.
When he was almost done eating, one of the women asked him "What do they eat in your country?" prompting Andrés to reflect on the nonphysical distance between the Aymara community and Bolivians like himself.

A few weeks before the second round of elections in Peru, the choice between the candidate of Gana Perú, Ollanta Humala Tasso and the daughter of the ex-president Alberto Fujimori, Keiko Sofía Fujimori (for Fuerza 2011), the growing polarisation in Peruvian society, and ultimately from the electorate, is as notable in the press as it is on social networks.
The most striking news these days is the recent dismissal of two journalists from the local news channel Canal N, property of the "El Comercio" group of companies, supposedly for not complying to instructions to display coverage in favour of Keiko Fujimori.
This action has generated feelings of disgust within the journalistic community as well as with the colleagues of those fired.
Raúl Tola, journalist and colleague of Patricia Montero and José Jara, questions in his daily column in the periodical La República:
Blogger Setty criticizes a bill that, "tries to ban cycling on the street, putting the city ’ s booming cyclist population onto the sidewalk."
Saddam Hussein is making the rounds on social media, with a new recording claiming that the Iraqi dictator is alive and well and that his double Mikhail was the one executed on December 30, 2006.
Many netizens are quick to describe the video as phoney and assure readers that Saddam is dead and gone. Had he been alive, the former Iraqi dictator would have turned 74 today.
There are also more than 500 comments on the video, many by people who think the video is a hoax and that Saddam is indeed dead.
Other commentators pay tribute to Saddam and his leadership, and acknowledge that the tape could be real and that that Saddam could still be alive.
The ad on Facebook for the Saddam video Other accounts have also uploaded the video, which is being spread on social media platforms across the Arab world and there are Facebook advertisements to market the video as well.
From Egypt, Zeinobia, who blogs at Egyptian Chronicles, agrees that Saddam is dead: I believe that this is just fake phone call, I do not believe it for one second.
Congrats are pouring in after Kuwait-based blogger Lebanese Mark won a lawsuit.
He was sued by a restaurant for a review he posted in his blog.
RNS in Honduras Politics and Culture says that the plan to give one XO laptop to every child in Honduras "would be ideal for deployment in Honduras."
However, the blogger shows some skepticism: "At the actual cost, the original $3 million investment would buy 15075 XO laptops, not the 8000 computers the article specifies."
And recently, the Court of Appeals of San Juan (the capital city) decided that another female victim of domestic violence could not receive the protection offered by Law 54 because her relationship with the aggressor was allegedly only sexual. The feminist coalition Movimiento Amplio de Mujeres de Puerto Rico has been at the forefront in denouncing the recent attacks of a law (Law 54 of 1989) considered to be one of the most advanced pieces of legislation against domestic violence in Latin America. Recently, the Movimiento Amplio also published a post asking the head of the Office of the Women's Advocate and the Legislature to support the inclusion of all women, notwithstanding their sexual orientation, under the provisions of Law 54.
This was in response to a recently solved case where it was determined that a woman was murdered by her same sex partner.
It would be a mistake to suppose that this right-wing phalanx is guided in its zeal by some very conservative judicial or political ideology of principle.
It seems guided by no judicial or political principle at all, but only by partisan, cultural, and perhaps religious allegiance. It urges judicial restraint and deference to legislatures when these bodies pass measures that political conservatives favor … But the right wing coalition abandons restraint when it strikes down legislation that conservatives oppose … Ronald Dworkin, The Supreme Court Phalanx 47-48 (2008)
This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. Next Sunday May 8, 2011, Mexican citizens will march to demand the end to the "War on Drugs" and the removal of all government officials responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and the increase of insecurity and corruption.
Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, who became the leading voice of the discontent towards the government's method of tackling the drug trafficking problem after his son Juan Francisco was killed, is inviting all those who want 'peace and justice' to join the protests next Sunday.
Here is Javier Sicilia's message in English:
The protest will start on May 5 in Cuernavaca, a city close to the capital where Sicilia's son was killed, and will head all the way to the National University (UNAM) in Mexico City.
Neftali Granados (@ NeftaliGranados) tweeted the route to follow.
The itinerary for the protest in Mexico is available at the official site of Red Paz y Justicia (Peace and Justice Network).
A Facebook page has also been set up with the details.
Furthermore, there is another official blog dedicated to the details of the different protests throughout the country.
Newspaper La Jornada is fully supporting the protest and publishing editorials frequently to get the goals of the May 8 protests across.
Professor John M. Ackerman, a strong and respected voice from Mexican civil society, writes:
Lorca, in the region of Murcia, Spain, was shaken by two earthquakes on May 11.
The earthquakes, magnitudes 4.1 and 5.1 on the Richter Scale, and their subsequent aftershocks, have caused nine casualties to date and approximately 300 injured.
Thousands of victims have had to relocate, seeking refuge.

Solidarity towards the “Ciudad del Sol ” (“ City of the Sun ”) was felt immediately through Twitter, under the # terremotomurcia and # todosconlorca hashtags used to spread information and show solidarity.
Supporters opened an account on Facebook, Apoyo por el Terremoto de Murcia (Support for the Murcia Earthquake) that already has thousands of messages, and Murcian blogs share their sorrow, such as in María en el Atelier.

Athlete Raúl Guevara tells us the striking experience of what he lived through and saw in his city.
And he does not forget the campaign for the next local elections:
M. Luk ’ aña Champi wonders why Bolivia doesn't have a TV channel in Aymara or Quechua, considering that the country is now ruled by an 'indigenous government': "Modern media like radio and television are ways to keep a language alive and in full use.
When a language is not used that language dies. "
This post is part of our special coverage The Death of Osama Bin Laden and Indigenous Rights.
For the United States government, "Geronimo EKIA" (Enemy Killed In Action) is the code for Osama Bin Laden's death.
For many Native Americans, however, comparing their folk hero Geronimo to the world's number one terrorist is offensive.
The Washington Post isolates Geronimo ’ s elusiveness, “was rumored to be able to walk without leaving any tracks, ” as the key trait that links him to Bin Laden. This is meant to illustrate some degree of respect the American military leaders have for their foe.
It also serves to cast the United States in a better light.
We are, after all, magnanimous in victory.
They won the fight by besting a legend.
Whether it was intended only to name the military operation to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden or to give Osama Bin Laden himself the code name Geronimo, either was an outrageous insult and mistake.
And it is clear from the military records released that the name Geronimo was used at times by military personnel involved for both the military operation and for Osama Bin Laden himself.
Leaving only for history the fact this insult to Native Americans occurred in all its pity. This post is part of our special coverage The Death of Osama Bin Laden and Indigenous Rights.
Thousands have taken to the streets this week in Spain to protest against corruption, unemployment, and a political structure that favors a two-party system. "We're not merchandise in the hands of bankers and politicians," was the motto of tens of thousands who demonstrated all over the country on May 15, 2011, a few days before the upcoming regional elections.
It did not stop there.
The demonstrations were followed by a peaceful sit-in on May 16, with hundreds camping at Madrid's main square, la "Puerta del Sol."
The movement, mainly coordinated by the youth organization Democracia Real Ya, has been extremely active online.

Ignacio Escolar in Público reports:
This post is part of our special coverage Global Development 2011. The International Museum of Women's online exhibit on women and the economy, features slideshows, podcasts, videos and essays on women from countries such as Sudan, Denmark, Philippines, USA, Costa Rica, Mexico, Argentina and how they view issues such as poverty, business, family, rights, money and much more.
Economica, IMOW's online interactive exhibit sets out to explore women's contribution in the global economy.
Picturing Power and Potential, was a juried photography exhibit showing different ways in which women participate in the economy and are agents of change.
For example, the exhibit's Community Choice Award winner was Brenda Paik Suno, a third generation Korean-American who took pictures of a Jeju Granny of the Sea, a woman who is part of the tradition of female divers of the Jeju Islands who have harvested the sea for generations.

Focusing on Latin America brings us perspectives on how the crisis affected the women in three different countries of the region: Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina, and how they are facing the new challenges brought by the rising participation of their countries in the world's economy. Version in Spanish here.
Young Women Speaking the Economy asked women from four different countries to send in their thoughts on diverse economic issues.
Ally Zeifman tackled the subject of relative poverty through an audio interview.
First she started by asking people in Denmark to answer if they thought there was poverty in Denmark, and then by interviewing a woman who believes that she is one of the invisible Danish poor.
On her project page, you can hear the audio and read an introduction to the subject and see a picture slideshow with quotes from the interview illustrating what being poor in Denmark looks like.
Some of the quotes such as "I graduated from the university, but I am unemployed", "My son really wanted to play football, but I cannot afford all the shoes and equipment, so in the end i decided it's better to just get some food on the table" and "I know I am not poor like in Africa, but I have to say no a lot" might ring bells with anyone who has been in a tight financial situation.
Valeene Salanga of Philippines reflects on how even a college education is no guarantee to a brighter future, when getting that first job seems to be a path riddled with obstacles for which she, a recent graduate, felt unprepared:
There is much more to see, read and listen in Economica, and women can also participate and submit their own creative work focusing on the economy. This post is part of our special coverage Global Development 2011.
Caribbean bloggers write about how one man's delusion had an impact on the region and put a humourous spin on surviving the end of the world. Jamaican blogger Stunner's Afflictions was... shall we say... stunned to discover that:
He goes on to point out the irony of the fact that: Camping and his followers, however, despite claiming to be followers of God has completely disregarded the very word of God himself, which states that only God knows the exact time when He will brig fourth his judgement on those who fail to serve him. The Bible states in several books that only God himself can say when this great day will be.
Things does get tough like drought and them-these people does hold out for high-high price! Blogging from Trinidad and Tobago, Outlish's Afiya Ray goes to great lengths not to "pour criticism on anyone's personal beliefs".
But Camping is not the first who thinks he can beat God's word with his own prophesy and he shall certainly not be the last.
As the Brazilian Congress debates a new Forest Code, and as the Environment Ministry launches new raids on illegal deforestation in Brazil, forest defender José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva was shot dead.
He had announced his life was under threat in the TEDxAmazonia conference, last November.
The news came in the form of an email from her younger sister Claudia: Paulina Aguilera Muñoz, Global Voices author from Chile, had unexpectedly passed away.
As the Latin America regional editor for Global Voices I had been in contact with Paulina only the day before, working on a post about a blogger that had been detained in Ecuador for alleged offenses against the Attorney General.
The news of her passing was shocking and heartbreaking for the Global Voices community.
A journalist by profession and a mother of two girls, Paulina worked in Chile, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Colombia on issues of development, human rights, gender and communications.
She blogged, in Spanish, at Varios Mundos Para Vagabundos / as (Various Worlds for Vagabonds) and Kanguro: Turismo Seguro y Barato (Kanguro: Safe and Inexpensive Tourism).
Paulina started writing for Global Voices in September of 2010.
There were countless messages of condolences and love as soon as I shared the news on our community mailing lists. From across Latin America, as well as far away in India, Serbia, South Korea, Sweden, Bahrain, Maldives, Peru, Tanzania, Ukraine, Tunisia, France, Pakistan, United States, she is missed and remembered by friends.
Solana Larsen, Managing Editor for Global Voices, wrote: "I will remember her as someone who was cheerful and funny on the mailing list and also a blogger who was keen and energetic to defend women's rights and indigenous rights," pointing to a post Paulina wrote on her personal blog for Blog Action Day, where she wrote about clean water as a right for indigenous peoples.
Chilean author Felipe Cordero said he admired Paulina's dedication in covering human rights issues in Chile and Latin America for Global Voices.
Firuzeh Shokooh Valle, our Spanish Language Editor, remembered how much she had enjoyed Paulina's post about Natividad Llanquileo, the indigenous spokeswoman for the Mapuche on a hunger strike in Chile.
Ela Stapley, a translator for Global Voices, mentioned Paulina's coverage of a prison fire in Chile: "I liked this post by her mainly because it dealt with people that society prefers to forget.
In writing it she reminded us that prisoners are people too. "
Paulina was a key contributor in covering a police strike that took place in Ecuador on September 30, 2010.
Her work alongside Ecuadorian author Milton Ramirez helped us create a Special Coverage page for the strike. Her dedication, professionalism, enthusiasm and passion will be greatly missed by everyone at Global Voices.
I will personally remember her as an exemplary woman and friend.
We send our sincere condolences to her two daughters, her parents, sisters, friends and all those who, like us, had the honor of associating with Paulina.
This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. The YouTube video showing a kindergarten teacher singing with her students to keep them calm during a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico has spread almost virally through the Spanish speaking countries.
The video recorded by the teacher on a cellphone shows a classroom full of very young children lying on the floor.
The teacher is heard gently asking her students to keep their heads on the floor while shots are heard in the background.
She reassures the children that everything is ok, and that they'll be safe in the classroom, reminding them to keep their heads down.
To distract them, she starts singing with them.
She selects the Raindrop Song from the Barney show: in Spanish, it wonders about what would happen if raindrops were made out of chocolate and how you'd open the mouth wide to catch them all.
By getting the children to sing the song she managed not only to keep them calm but also to have them stay with their heads on the floor, as she prompted them to turn over and look up to the sky with their mouths opened wide.
Local media has identified the school as being located in the Colonia Nueva Estanzuela, just meters away from where an armed group on seven vans arrived to murder five people at an independent taxi base, and the teacher, whose identity is yet unknown has been called a hero and has been recognized by media and viewers for showing courage, character and love to her wards.
April 19, 2011 marked the third anniversary of the well-known Factory Case: the fire at the Factory discotheque in Ecuadorian capital Quito in 2008, during a Gothic-rock concert.
There were 19 deaths as a result of the fire and 24 wounded.
Among the deceased were all the members of the rock band Zelestial, and even now some of the survivors suffer repercussions from the tragedy.
Although there was a trial and sentence in the case, the family and friends of the victims continue to meet to plead for justice, and above all, the non-exclusion of rockers of diverse genres, permitting them to come together and perform in any part of the city and not only in secluded places with dubious security.

"Paremos las balas, pintemos las fuentes" (Let's stop the bullets, let's paint the fountains) is a Mexican social movement that calls for justice and recalls the country's government's actions on several crimes that have not had a clear judicial procedure.
To the amazement of pedestrians that circulated around the capital Mexico City during the last weekend of May 2011, activists stained the water of the famous statue of "Diana la Cazadora" (Diana the Huntress) in the Paseo de la Reforma -one of the most important avenues in Mexico City - blood red.
Activists walked around the monument shouting slogans like "Not one more dead!" and "Out Calderón!"
The police tried to stop the protest, but thanks to its peaceful nature the participants were allowed to continue with their manifestation.
Iroel Sánchez Espinosa, author of the blog La pupila insomne, describes the situation:
This post is part of our special coverage Japan Earthquake 2011.
More than two months have passed since the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan and while those who weren ’ t affected directly by the disaster have been able to go back to a normal life, around 110,000 people are still living in evacuation centers according to police estimates.
The lack of privacy, separation from their original community, unemployment and a deep sorrow for the loss of loved ones has been a harrowing experience for many victims who are physically and emotionally exhausted.

French feminist bloggers and women bloggers writing on women's issues, have gained a larger audience and a new respect in France in the aftermath of the Domininique Strauss-Kahn (DSK) scandal. They were the first and very few voices reminding that there was a woman involved, possibly a victim, and they drew attention to the biased and sexist coverage of the French media. Meet a few French feminist bloggers, blogging from different perspectives but all laboring online against prejudices and the French perception of sexual harassment and crimes.

This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
One can bear in mind that in recent days, around 15,000 Aymaras seized the city of Puno, after which they incited violence that paralised the Puno capital for days and left many tourists stranded.
The government has rejected the cancellation, but came to an agreement with the Aymara communities to suspend mining and petroleum concessions in Puno for 14 months in four provinces (Yunguyo, Chucuito, Callao, and Juli).
However, these indigenous communities are also demanding a repeal of the Decreto Supremo 082-2007-EM (Supreme Decree 082-2007-EM), according to Walter Adurviri, President of the Front for the Defense of Natural Resources in the Southern Zone of Puno.
Aduviri told the Puno newspaper Los Andes that although he saw the victory of nationalist candidate Ollanta Humala in a positive light, the Aymara would not content themselves with his promises, but would demand written agreements.
Meanwhile, the president of the Regional Government of Puno, Mauricio Rodriguez, has requested that president-elect Ollanta Humala intervene in this matter.
The Aymara and the Quechua, who will soon be joined by communities in others zones of Puno, demand that their right to prior consultation be respected in the granting of mining and petroleum concessions, provided that these types of economic activities contaminate the environment and destroy the traditional way of life, a claim that the blogger Peruanista captures here:

In Panama, the media has already started speculating about potential candidates and winners, despite there being two years to go until the next elections.
The different parties are starting to sound out voters in the middle of some electoral reforms that would implement a run-off vote.
One potential nomination for president which caused the most commotion in the Panamanian cyberspace was that of the well-known sports commentator Juan Carlos Tapia.
Tapia hosts a boxing programme at 9pm on Thursdays.
He always dedicates the first few minutes of his show to criticising and reflecting on political topics, which in many cases have caused a negative response but also garnered support from viewers.
It is one of the most popular television programmes in Panama and because of this, reactions to Tapia's potential candidature did not take long to appear.

She shared some marketing strategies:
"use sweet words and your users' language: this will make them trust you (you are friendly) and they can understand you (why use an English literary style when they use a mix of Khmer and short English words). They feel they are like you.
They were also eager to understand methods that would promote better client interaction. More importantly, such informal gathering was perceived to be useful for women business networking in the country. Dr. Lili Sisombat, the event organizer and the creator of “Cambodia Women in Business ” page, hopes that such unique networking in the business community will be sustained.

Amid news of the Fuzhou bombings on Thursday, something remarkable was taking place on Sina Weibo: earlier this week, citizens from across the country began announcing their decision to run this autumn as independent candidates in their local People's Congress elections at the municipal district level, voting for which is open to the public.
Among them are journalists Li Chengpeng and Yao Bo.

Haleh was leading the procession with flowers and a picture of her father when plain-clothed agents charged forward and tried to tear away the picture.
Eye-witnesses said the security agents used batons and that she collapsed and died on the way to hospital. Ezzatollah and Haleh Sahabi
Iranian blogger Zede Kodeta (Anti Coup d'Etat) encourages people to go to the rooftops and chant anti regime slogans, in order to protest against what happened to Haleh.
Another blogger Artenoos writes:
Haleh was a 56 year-old women's rights activist and a Koran researcher.
She was arrested on August 5, 2009 when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was inaugurated for a second term. She was one of the protesters present beside the Parliament of Iran.
She was beaten by security forces... She believed you can find equality between men and women, if you read The Koran through a woman's prism and concerns.
Blogger Tweatter writes: How many Haleh Sahabis should be killed until we finish with our indifference? How long we should wait, and be pleased to see Obama say, "the first demonstrations in the region began in Iran"?
Does no one remember 'you do something if you finish it'?

Global Voices co-founder and long time fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Ethan Zuckerman, has been named director of MIT's Center for Civic Media and a principal research scientist at MIT's Media Lab.
He begins on 1 September, 2011. We've been congratulating Ethan internally at Global Voices, and all hope to learn from and contribute to the research ahead! The research center (formerly known as Center for Future Civic Media) was founded in 2007 with support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to explore the opportunities and challenges of news and information in a digital age.
On Wednesday, the Knight Foundation announced an additional investment of $3.76 million for the Center to expand its work and reach. In an interview with Andrew Phelps published Wednesday morning by Harvard's Nieman Lab, Ethan explains that the Center will be looking beyond citizen journalism to investigate how communities communicate more broadly, and how they make decisions about becoming "civically active."
And that ’ s an issue that ’ s really front and center to some of the past work at Center for Future Civic Media. On his own blog, Ethan says he is excited that the Center will work on a combination of practical and theoretical projects:

Lanterns, dances, flowers and bonfires were some of the elements used in celebrations all over the world in observance of the Summer and Winter Solstices.
Let's tour around the world to check out the different celebrations: Solstice at Stonehenge, Feast of Saint John's bonfires in Spain, Inti Raymi in Peru, we tripantu in Chile and Kupala Day in Russia or Midsummer's night in Poland.

In Coruña, Spain, bonfires, drinking and parades marked the Bonfires of Saint John's festivities.
It is traditional for teens and children to jump over the bonfires an allotted number of times for good luck: sadly, this year's celebrations were marred by the death of two people, one of which died when he tripped while trying to jump over one of the biggest bonfires, perishing in the middle of the fire to unsuccessful attempts to rescue him by onlookers.

Iranian security forces are back in the streets for a sequel to their infamous action of 2007: arresting dogs.
The last crackdown lasted only a short time, and the dogs were soon released.
According to Iranian newspapers, several dogs were recently confiscated and moved to 'temporary to jail'.
Iran's government considers keeping pet dogs un-Islamic, but has mostly tolerated it. It is possible that because the people most likely to keep dogs are Iran's urban and educated youth, dogs may be generating more official hostility again.
Animal Persian blog writes with humor and irony about what heavy crimes animal lovers in Iran may face being prosecuted for in the future:

On Friday, June 17 the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution expressing “grave concern at the violence and discrimination experienced by people because of their sexual orientation..."
As part of the resolution, the Council called for a global study of discrimination against LGBT communities around the world.
The resolution passed narrowly: twenty-three members voted in favor of the resolution, while nineteen voted against it, and three abstained.
Among the nations that supported the measure was Cuba.
In the days following the resolution, Cuban bloggers and Twitter users celebrated this significant victory for the island ’ s LGBT communities.

Moroccans went to the polls today to vote on reforms on a new constitution offered by King Mohammed VI.
Although praised by many analysts and royalists, the reforms on the table did not live up to the expectations of politicians and activists, who were looking for a true democracy, with a separation of powers and the ceding of the monarch's absolute power to an elected parliament.
The King's offer was made following four months of street protests calling for reforms, which started hot on the heels of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions on February 20. Mamfakinch, a news portal by Moroccan bloggers and activists which runs in Arabic and French, live-blogged citizen media reactions on the vote here.
In one tweet, he writes: @ ibnkafka: According to @ Lm9dma, voting officials tell voters not to bother voting as "official" results are already decided upon # dostour # morocco In another, he tweets:

This post is part of our special coverage Morocco Protests 2011.
On Friday 1 July, 2011, Morocco voted in a referendum on a draft Constitution proposed by King Mohammed VI.
Official results show an overwhelming support of the reform, with more than 98 per cent saying 'Yes'.
Democracy protesters have been calling for the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy with a clear separation of powers.
By consecrating the King as head of the State, the Judiciary and the military, the proposed Constitution, the protesters say, fell short of their demands, offering only limited powers to the prime minister and parliament.
The democracy movement contested the results, denouncing widespread irregularities.
Bloggers have been sharing videos supposedly showing violations of electoral law during election day.
The blog 24-Mamfakinch published the following video showing unidentified individuals, allegedly tampering with a ballot box well after the closure of the polling station and before any votes were counted:
There were also rallies on Sunday in support of the King, who is still popular. These videos, respectively from Tangier Rabat and Casablanca, were posted by 24-Mamfakinch:
Protesters say the changes do not go far enough and are pledging to keep up pressure on the regime until what they consider real reforms are implemented.

July 5, 2011, presented an interesting challenge to the traditional Bulgarian media: would they follow a Facebook appeal for "A Day Without Boyko Borisov" - or would they continue to report on the activities of Bulgaria's Prime Minister?
Reuters noticed the Facebook event, and let it run through its cable, under the title that fit quite well with the intent of the organizers: "Bulgarians beg for a day without busy PM Borisov."
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.

However, the Bulgarian media, with the two memorable exceptions - news agency BGNES and Internet site Mediapool - did not follow the initiative and continued to feature the PM in their news items.
Bulgarian blogger and former member of the Parliament Borislav Tsekov shared BGNES 'opinion in full, just saying "completely agree."
Other bloggers also noticed and wrote about the initiative, sometimes with ironic and sarcastic comments or titles of their publications, aimed at the Prime Minister.
In a very passionate and sad entry, Nelly of Politics is arts was quite critical towards the Bulgarian media, asking why "do I have to read news from foreign sites, watch foreign tv stations, and prefer the bloggers' opinions, instead that of the journalists."
Prime Minister Borisov himself announced that he was not interested in such events, and then immediately commented that the organizers were being paid by the opposition.
One of the organizers of the event, Mr. Atanas Palov, noted that this is ridiculous, and joked that if the prime minister pays enough, they could create an alternative "One day with Boyko Borisov" event.
The three young people (the other two are Ms. Kamelia Encheva and Ms. Valia Krusheva) who had come up with the idea denied any political involvement; one of them lives in Austria, one in Belgium, and one in Bulgaria, and they do not seem to be politically motivated.
The date of July 5 was chosen because it marked two years since the 2009 elections, in which Borisov was the winner.
After the end of the event, the organizers published an open letter, in which they explained that the initiative was not aimed against the Prime Minister, but rather towards the attention the Bulgarian media give to Boyko Borisov. At the same time, they acknowledged that the idea had been borrowed from the Italian "No Berlusconi Day" and the Polish "Day Without Smolensk".

Most cultures accompany their meals with a grain based product; bread, flatbreads and steamed buns are part of people's meals in many places of the world.
Today we visit artisans and cooks to see how they prepare and make the food that feeds them and their families.
First we make a stop in France, as baker Vincent Talleu makes croissants, chocolate bread and other similar products using the same dough as the base:
Here, we watch a woman cooking roti chapatis in her kitchen, flattening them with a rolling pin on a wooden board, cooking them on a tava or flat metal skillet and then finishing them off on an open flame where they puff up like ballons:
These next videos show variations on the showmanship of flatbread makers: from speed and agility in shaping, flattening and slapping chapatis to cook on the inside of a brick oven to a production line where parottas fly through the air before getting put on a stove:

Throughout Central America, the corn tortilla is the staple food of many; although you can purchase freshly made tortillas, some people still cook them following the traditional techniques.
In Zacualtipán of Hidalgo, Mexico a century-old kitchen is the stage for corn and masa grinding on a stone metate, palming the tortilla into its round shape and then cooking them on a wood stove:
This woman flattens the tortillas using a piece of plastic bag on a table so that the tortilla can spin while it's being shaped:
In Turkey, the flatbread of choice is the yufka.

Almost 98% people of Bangladesh are Bengalis and they speak the Bangla language.
Chakmas are ethnically Tibeto-Burman, and are closely related to the Himalayan tribes. According to history, they are originally from Arakan (present Rakhine State of Burma) who hundreds of years ago wandered and settled in different parts of India and Bangladesh.
In recent months many Bangladeshi indigenous people have taken the streets holding meetings, human chains and rallies, demanding constitutional recognition of their population.
The 'indigenous' debate arose after some remarks of a special parliamentary committee working to amend the present constitution reverting back to the 1972 constitution.
There was no reference of tribal or indigenous people in Bangladesh ’ s first constitution of 1972 where it was mentioned that Bangladesh would be the land of Bengalis.
Members of indigenous communities demanded their recognition in the constitution as “indigenous people ” instead of tribal or proposed“ minority ethnic group ” at central Shahidminar in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Image by Abu Ala, Copyright Demotix, 29 April 2011.
The debate is in how will they be recognised. ”
“The government is reluctant to recognise indigenous people as“ indigenous ” as it questions ethnicity of the country's native Bangalees.
Monjurul Haque at the Indigenous Bangla blog writes about the complexity of the situation:
"In the constitution, all minorities were recognised generically as minorities, and through the 15th amendment, the present government has categorised them as' ethnic minorities' and no longer only as' tribal 'people."
She also said:
She reminded about the 4000 year old tradition of the Bengalis in this land:
“The ethnic Bengalees are not colonial settlers, neither are they foreigners or non-indigenous to their own native land and never will be. ”
Biplob Rahman, a journalist and a blogger protests the government's stand that there is no indigenous people in Bangladesh.
He quotes from Chakma King and member, UN Permanent Forum On Indigenous Issues, Debashish Roy's recent rebuttal:
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
He began with photographs of the coastal city of Tripoli - photos showing the city markets where vegetable vendors are located by roadsides, brass workers in the alleys or "Zangas" of the old city, and even those who sell ostrich eggs. In addition, he shares other photos which show the historic features of the city, such as the Ottoman castle Al-Saraaya Al-Hamra (the Red Castle) which is located Tripoli old city, and hosts a national museum of Roman architecture, mosaics and sculptures. Other photos showed Gaddafi's slogan and banners all over the city, Martyrs Square, which Gaddafi changed its name later to Green Square.
It seems that even statues are not safe in Iran.
Religious motives appear to be behind the recent theft of several bronze statues of Iranian national heroes from public places.
In the northern city Sari, authorities ordered the destruction of 16 bronze statutes depicting the Iranian mythological hero and archer Arash Kamangir on chariots and with horses.
Iranian mythological hero and archer, Arash Kamangir.
The official reason was ostensibly that the horses on Imam Square could be interpreted as insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomenei.
Kamangir is said to have infused his own life into his arrow, and used it to expand the borders of Iran. The statues have decorated the public squares in Sari since 1975.
Easy targets Azarmehr writes that more statues are being targeted these days, as Iranian authorities pursue their rage against Iran's pre-Islamic history. He says:
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution however, the Islamic Republic has been hell bent on its anti-Iranian agenda.
The regime fears all symbols of pre-Islamic Iran.
In recent weeks, this anti-Iranian agenda has manifested itself in removing wall paintings that depicted the Epic stories of Shahnameh (Book of Kings) in Mashad, the removal of the statues of another Iranian legendary figure, Arash in Sari and now they want to remove the statue of Ariobarzanes in Yassuj. Several bloggers such as Osyan Sabz have photographed the empty spots left behind after the statues were removed and destroyed:
Colombian singer Álvaro José Arroyo González, better known as Joe Arroyo, born in a humble neighborhood in Cartagena on November 1, 1955, passed away on July 16 at 07: 45 A.M. in Barranquilla due to multiple organ failure for which he had been hospitalized at Clinica La Asunción, a hospital in Barranquilla, for 29 days.
Joe Arroyo began his career at age 8 and participated in several salsa groups around the country, but he became famous when he joined the group “Fruko y sus Tesos ”.
Later, in 1981 he founded his own salsa group, “La Verdad ”, traveling to many countries around the world. The prolific singer-songwriter even created his own dance beat, 'el Joesón', mixing salsa with Colombian Caribbean music like the cumbia, the porro, and the champeta.

This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. Global Voices in Spanish is interested in encouraging blogging and promoting blogger networks, and is currently doing so through its' Festivales de Blogs' (Blog Carnival).
The Carnival helps generate original content with a certain level of reflection and analysis, and participating bloggers can at the same time benefit greatly from the visibility their work gains by being referenced on Global Voices (GV).
Let's look at the details of our Carnival:
Scope: Mexico
As the geographic base and center of out first 2011 Blog Carnival, GV has chosen Mexico, a great country going through a period of violence that has yet to cease.
Aside from this, we have a number of collaborators in Mexico that have supported us in the spread of this virtual event.
While the majority of the bloggers, and the most well-known ones, are found in Mexico City, we also expect participation from bloggers in cities like Guadalajra, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Ciudad Juárez and many others.
We would like to clarify that participation is not restricted to bloggers or blogs that are dedicated exclusively to the topic indicated in the following paragraph - any blog and blogger can participate.
Topic: Citizenry, violence and blogs
Violence has a constant presence in human societies, but in some cases it becomes a preponderant element, interrupting that which we consider the normal development of our lives.
A current case of this in our hemisphere is the violence in Mexico, of the so-called 'Mexico Drug War,' which exemplifies our incapacity, as well as that of the governments, to deal with this problem.
In a context like the one described there are always stories that are not shown via traditional media, stories of resilience that we should all know.
Is the media part of the solution for this context of the conflict or simply a further instrument of this violence?
Is regulating the media's coverage of the violence recommended?
If so, who would do it: readers, the media, NGOs or the government? Are there tangible results from activist campaigns (online and otherwise) against the violence in Mexico?
The post has to be an original post, in other words, created by the blogger, not copied from another source, and published during the period set for participation in the Carnival.
The structure, style and length of the post can be decided by the blogger.
Bloggers can pick how to focus on the topic.
It can be through one of the suggested questions or from a focus that the blogger considers convenient.
When bloggers have published their post for the Carnival, they must email juan.arellano at globalvoicesonline dot org with the following information:
Name of the author
Name of the blog
Title of the post
Corresponding link or URL for the post.
A button is available, the image in this post, for bloggers to use and paste on their blogs as a signal that they are participating in the Carnival.
Once the button is added to a blog, the blogger must reference this post.
At the end of the period of participation we will proceed to arrange and summarize the participating post in order to publish a summary post for Global Voices. Depending on the amount of participation we will be able to quote posts or not, this is mainly due to reasons of space.
Any questions may be directed to the email mentioned above.
Results from our previous Blog Carnivals can be seen from: Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru.
Chronology: Activities carried out throughout the blog carnival will be as follows: - Call, invitation and dissemination.
Through this post and during the duration of the period for participation.
- Period for participation.
From August 1 to 10.
- Selection period and the creation of a summary with the participating posts.
From August 11 to 15.
- Summary post published on Global Voices in Spanish.
August 16. Note: This is not a competition, therefore there will be no winners or losers.

This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War.
This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. Ciudad Juárez is considered the most violent city in Mexico with more than 3,100 murders recorded in 2010, with an average of 9 homicides per day.
Women are not immune to this violence, and cases of femicides committed years ago are still unresolved. Banner from 'Not One More' anti-femicide campaign, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
Marisela Escobedo, who was fighting for the persecution of her daughter ’ s murderer, was chased and gunned down at plain sight in front of the governor ’ s office, where she was leading a protest.
Less than a month later, Susana Chávez, a poet who coined the phrase “Ni una más (Not one more death) ”, was tortured, killed and left in the street with her hand severed.
Later, Rizzo reflects on Chavez's and Escobedo's stories of courage:
These women acted courageously despite being abandoned by the state.
Both spoke about it as loudly and openly as they could. Finally, she talks about the future of activism led by women in Mexico:
After these murders, female protesters now cover their faces, both to protect themselves and to represent the humiliation that the victims, their daughters and friends, have endured.

On the eve of Ramadan, Syrian troops have entered the city of Hama, reportedly killing as many as 45 people by 11: 00 am on Sunday, July 31.
The assault has particular resonance for Syrians, as the city of Hama was the site of one of the most horrific massacres in modern history.
Most tweets at this early hour are links to news, though many from within Syria, and abroad have condemned the killings, with some expressing anger at a perceived lack of international outrage.
Still others, such as deekelgen963, expressed doubt about the reporting from Hama.
Of the view original reports coming across the Twitter lines, one stands out.
Debkafile reports: "Water, power, phone lines cut for Hama's 400,000 inhabitants". Meanwhile, from inside Hama, a few videos have emerged.
Another video shows black smoke rising up from within the city:
BBC journalist Shaimaa Khalil pointed to live streaming video coming from Hama, the archive of which is available here.
Without the presence of professional journalists in Hama, reporting is reliant on activists and citizen journalists, for whom capturing images and videos comes with considerable risk.
As a result, news is often slow to trickle out, but some Syrian activists, such as @ wissamtarif and @ malathaumran are continuously tweeting news.

Below is a call for volunteers on May 4, 2011:
Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on Languages and the Internet.
One of the newest Global Voices Lingua sites is also its first in an indigenous language, Aymara.
This native language is spoken by more than 2 million people across the Andes, especially in Bolivia and Peru, where it is among the official languages.
There are also people who speak Aymara in parts of Chile and Argentina, as well as in the Aymara diaspora.
The first translation of Global Voices in Aymara was published in September 2009 and continued with intermittent publication for the next year.
Once Victoria Tinta took the helm as editor, the site began to produce regular translations from Global Voices in Spanish to Aymara.
In addition to proofreading and formatting translations, Victoria has been responsible for recruiting and coordinating the team of volunteer translators.
In all, there are have been 21 volunteers who have contributed with a translation, and there is a core group of approximately one dozen who have produced regular translations.
Global Voices in Aymara Editor Victoria Tinta at the Brazilian Digital Culture Forum in São Paulo in October 2010.
The new site is an initiative of the Jaqi Aru project based in El Alto, Bolivia and aims to contribute to the availability of content in the Aymara language on the internet, as a way to promote and preserve their native tongue.
Most of the translators and members of the Jaqi Aru project are students in the Linguistics Department of the Public University of El Alto (UPEA for its initials in Spanish), and hold a passion for conserving the language for future generations.
The partnership with Global Voices enables the group to provide valuable content in the Aymara language about current events and cultural issues from around the world.
While all of the translators are bilingual in Aymara and Spanish, and in some cases, multilingual, this translation project is still in its early stages.
In many cases, words do not exists in Aymara for the text that appears in Global Voices articles. To help in such cases, there are projects such as Runasimipi that attempt to build consensus for the translation of a particular word, especially words related to technology.
But in many cases, these translations are an individual's proposal for how something should be translated.
This interpretation may vary from translator to translator, but beginning in this manner leaves room for discussion, thus helping each translator improve upon their work.
Members of the Global Voices in Aymara translation team.
It may be true that most readers of Global Voices in Aymara have no trouble reading Global Voices in Spanish instead, but the project is part of a larger goal of encouraging Aymara speakers, especially young people, to embrace the language of their ancestors.
Making interesting content available on the Internet, is only the first step for the Jaqi Aru project and the Global Voices in Aymara translation team in hopefully setting an example for other indigenous and minority language communities around the world.

It all has to do with adaptation and it is clear that never the majority will adapt to the minority, even if the latter is imperial, frustrated and full of complexes, because they have ended up being a minority where once there was a false “big Soviet motherland. ”

This August Mexico celebrates one hundred years of the birth of comedian Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas.
In Mexico, and throughout Latin America Cantinflas is recognized as a great actor and one of Mexico's most admired comedians. Generation after generation, children and adults have laughed together with his movies, television shows and comics.
In Cuéntame, blogger Axel Caballero begins his post writing about the importance of Cantinflas in his early memories: I remember growing up watching old Cantinflas movies.
For the rest of August, the late comic actor will be the subject of exhibitions, film retrospectives, panel discussions and even a dance in his honor.
Cantinflas is still a movie star of the people.
His characters always reflected the downtrodden, which is something the actor prided himself on.
In the same post he mentions the importance of Cantinflas in other continents:
And don't think that Cantinflas' presence was just felt in Latin America.
Tropical storm Irene made landfall in Puerto Rico on August 21st leaving wind damage, floods, constant rain, and the evacuation of entire communities.

Indymedia points out that poor black women were the most affected by the weather phenomena:
Global Voices and Mi Voz - a Chilean network of online citizen newspapers - have just launched a new partnership.
Every month Global Voices will publish an article with stories from Mi Voz, amplifying the voices of their citizen correspondents to an international audience.
Meanwhile, Mi Voz will publish an article prepared by Global Voices with content agreed on by the editors of both organizations.
In addition, both will share any additional content freely, in accordance with Creative Commons policies.
Global Voices readers have had a little taste of Mi Voz thanks to the articles written Katie Manning, a reporter for Mi Voz and the first contact that helped us initiate discussions to start this partnership.
Katie will continue to share content from Mi Voz in English on Global Voices.
With this partnership Global Voices will enhance its coverage of Chilean news from a hyperlocal citizen perspective focused on news outside the capital, Santiago.
Mi Voz has more than 10,000 citizen journalists reporting for their 18 media outlets from 14 regions across the country.
Founded in 2005, Mi Voz say that they are moved by "the goal of generating media where all those different actors shaping the local reality can actively engage on dialogue, take action on the issues they care about, and open new doors as they push local agendas."
Mi Voz announced this partnership on their site El Paradiario 14.
The project of constructing a Western European identity without much space for immigrants brought a mix of laws, verbal affirmations of hate, and even blood-ridden attacks this summer of 2011.
In spring, restrictions were placed on inter-European border flexibility within the Schengen zone, including Denmark, and between France and Italy.
In July, Norway suffered a double attack from a mass murderer who strove for a renewed crusade and promulgated hatred towards Muslims and women.
This act motivated Abuy Nfubea, president of the Pan-African Federation of Black Communities in Spain, to establish a parallel between fearing the other, as much in Norway as in Spain, in an opinion piece entitled "Is there really someone that is surprised by Norway's racist crimes?":

“I believe if taken seriously, they can become professional stage actors as theatre is gaining popularity across the country, ” Chaka says.
Chaka has also been invited to teach literature to university students and says it feels great knowing that what he is doing is being taken seriously. “I will be teaching literature and stage acting to some university students as part of a course they are doing and this is one thing that I have wanted to do for a long time, ” he says.
As the world population grows to hit the 7 billion mark, and bleak stories are beamed by international news agencies, citizens of the world such as Chaka have found other means to make this a better place and contribute towards making a difference in their own small but very significant ways.
This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet and Indigenous Rights. Quechua, or Runa Simi, is one of the original languages of Peru, said to have emerged in the middle of the first millennium of our era.
Today, it is spoken by 8-10 million people and it is the most extended of the linguistic family in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador after Indo-European languages according to Wikipedia.
This same source adds:
The Prime Minister issued this statement after the results were announced: It is good that Singaporeans have had the chance to vote for their next President, and to focus on what the elected President is about. I thank the four candidates for putting themselves forward.
This explains why the winning margin is so narrow, and why the winner only gained slightly more than one-third of the total votes. Nevertheless, under our first-past-the-post system, the election has produced an unambiguous winner, who has the mandate to be the next President
AKIKONOMU explains why the presidency is largely a ceremonial position: The President is guardian of nothing Once the elected president was the guardian of the reserves of Singapore.
Then the constitution was changed so that the president is the guardian of only the current reserves.

This post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011.
Eight months after the fall of the regime of Ben Ali, police in Tunisia have still not given up their brutality and violations of human rights.
On Wednesday, Tunisian blogger Azyz Amamy (@ Azyyoz) was arrested and beaten up by police for telling a joke on bananas while he was near a police station.
He was released on the same day.
No one knows what Amamy's joke was, but it seems that it provoked the police officers. Indeed, last week, Interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi addressed the nation.
During his speech, he said that "97 per cent of the National Guard agents are good, and the rest are monkeys."
Azyz Amami, Twitter profile.
This might explain why the police reacted brutally to Amamy's joke.
Liliopatra reports:
In Bolivia, where unions are extensively formed by members of society, another group of workers have unionized: children. A story on child labor in Bolivia is presented by Jean-Friedman Rudovsky as part of a series Ground Shifters: Stories of Women Changing Unseen Worlds.
Mauricio Aira in the blog Bolivia Primera Plana argues that child labor is not a concern for Bolivian society, and adds: These children and adolescents work to help the family, to support themselves in their studies, to provide for their personal expenses, to secure themselves a better future compared to their fathers and brothers buried by silicosis and accidents in mines or plantations of sugar cane. Child labor in Bolivia.
They have formed unions to be protected by the government and treated respectfully by society. As Marion Gibney writes:
These are the words Iranian blogger Somayeh Tohidloo wrote in her blog after receiving 50 whip lashes in Evin Prison on September 14, 2011:
She was released after paying bail, but the flogging sentence was eventually upheld.
Once again thousands of protesters have poured into streets of Tabriz and Urmia in Iran's Azerbaijan region on Saturday to call on the Iranian government to save the dying Urmia Lake, one of the world's largest salt water lakes.
From dying lake to saving country
A photo of Lake Urmia from space in 1984 by NASA (PD via Wikimedia Commons) Iranian authorities quickly reacted by repressing protesters. The news was censored in Iran-based media, but several video were posted on YouTube and bloggers flooded cyber world with their posts.
Blogger Urmuiscierli writes that there were battles on the streets with security forces beating up and arresting protesters, and even tying them to trees. Some bloggers called on more Iranians to support the Azeri activists and relaunch anti-regime demonstrations around country.
The construction of a dam on part of the lake, accompanied by a recent drought has significantly decreased the annual amount of water Urmia receives.
This in turn has increased the salinity, repelling many birds and threatening permanent damage to the ecosystem.
If the lake dries out, millions of people in the region will need to resettle to survive.
Protesters in Urmia In Urmia, people say the lake is dying and that the authorities are responsible. Azarakan writes that the spark started in Azerbaijan, and that we should now support their struggle and do what we can to stop regime forces repressing Azeri people.
He says, this is a rare opportunity and that we should go on until freedom.
Mosbate1000 says that:
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for constructing such dams to make a lot of profit.
In such occasions they post and share links to divide Iranians.
Doughodushab calls on Iranians to defend Urmia Lake and Azerbaijan.
The blogger writes that we are all trapped by the Islamic regime and should protect our natural and cultural heritage.
Andarbab suggests that this Tuesday in Tehran and other cities people protest and demonstrate for supporting Azerbaijan.

On Monday in Tunis, the 3rd Arab Bloggers Meeting kicked off with a day-long public conference.
The meeting is co-hosted by Global Voices, Nawaat and Heinrich Böll Foundation and is attended by around 100 bloggers from nearly all Arab countries.
Naturally, the conference was well-blogged, not only on the official Arab Bloggers blog, but also by many participants.
Links to media and blog coverage are being collected here (please post in the comments section to let us know what we may have missed).
An Al Jazeera story about the meeting proclaimed: "Arab bloggers say Arab Spring has gone global".
English-language blog coverage included Jillian York's posts on Day 1, Part 1 and a special panel featuring Tunisian bloggers who are now involved with Tunisian politics in various ways.
The biggest news came from a ground-breaking talk by the new president of the Tunisian Internet Agency, in which he revealed that Tunisia secretly tested censorship software for Western companies.
Mohamed ElGohary, co-editor of Lingua Arabic.
Photo by Mohamed Alâa Guedich (used with permission) The meeting continues in a smaller, invitation-only workshop setting for the next three days.
Participants continue to tweet about the discussions in multiple languages using the # AB11 hashtag, and the conference blog will continue to post updates.
So stay tuned.
The 2nd Arab Bloggers Meeting, held in Beirut in 2009, is believed by many bloggers to have played an important role in building personal ties and trust among bloggers throughout the region - ties which enabled them to coordinate more easily during the Arab Spring.
The only candidate able to defeat President Paul Biya, who is described by some as a dictator and has been in power since November 6, 1982, is Paul Biya himself. Although his candidature for his own reelection has not really been a surprise, it still caused quite a stir in public opinion.
The fact is that in these stupid candidatures, we must see the invisible hand of the state party, the CPDM. If not, how do these people, who are virtually unknown even in their residential area, who are not even elected officials and do not belong to any political movement, managed to gather the necessary signatures for their application?

However, in an article published in 2010, economist Thierry Amougou, aware of this issue, had invited Cameroonians not to be forgetful and not to be fooled again by the regime in place, reminding them of milestones marking the "cycle" of Paul Biya at the helm of the Cameroonian State: Although polls across the world show that voters' choices are, on average, guided by events not older than six months at the date of the vote, Cameroonians are requested to have a longer memory this time.

Construction of the controversial hydroelectric dam project on the Ayeyarwaddy River located in the northern part of Myanmar has been suspended by the government.
President Thein Sein sent a letter to Parliament informing them that the dam project will be postponed for the sake of public interest. The project is one of the infrastructure investments by China in Myanmar.
The plan was to export the power generated from this plant to China.
Last month, Minister of Electric Power Zaw Min told reporters that the government will not suspend the project despite the concerns raised by some groups.
But public activities like petition signing, workshops and community seminars urging the government to stop the dam construction intensified in the past few weeks.
Even media organizations echoed the side of the public including well-known individuals who asked the president to cancel the project.

Zambia ’ s new President, Michael Sata, has in the last three elections he has participated in promised to transform the nation in 90 days including putting more money into people's pockets. Now that he has finally been elected head of state, expectant netizens have started the countdown.
Zambians try to catch a glimpse of the new President at his inauguration ceremony in September 2011.
The 90 days theory is already working.. Chinese mines have offered 80 percent salary increases on the Copperbelt to their workers, while Sun International has began paying out the sales charge arrears that were previously withheld and this has been accompanied by a salary increase.
HH has incited the youths of Mandevu that by 23rd December if there is no "more money in their pockets" they should match to state house and demand for their money...
Truth is only the blind have not noticed change. Some of this change brought on even by ourselves because we know we are now being led by action.
7.A workable agric & agro forest policy 8.A pro education, pro health, pro agriculture, pro science & technology, pro diversification from mining budget for 2012

Sunday, October 16 is Election Day across Bolivia.
However, this election is quite different from past elections. Noticeable are the lack of posters, painted walls, and public rallies that are typical of Bolivian elections. Candidates have been prohibited from public campaigning, and had to rely on limited media interviews and spots recorded by the Plurinational Electoral Organ.
What is also different for this election is that it will not determine a President, members of Congress, or local Mayors.
For the first time in Bolivia, as well as in Latin America, voters will choose 56 judges and magistrates for the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, Council of the Judiciary, and Agrarian / Environmental Tribunal.
These elections have been guaranteed by the new Constitution with the idea to eliminate the direct naming of judges by the political party that holds majority in Congress, as had previously been the practice. Even though there was a process to allow for objections to certain candidates that could not prove affiliation to a political party, many citizens believe that the ruling party Movement Towards Socialism (MAS for its initials in Spanish) will end up benefiting from the results.
Some of those sentiments come from a statement from Bolivian President Evo Morales in August 2011 at an event in Tolata, who said "I am sure, brothers and sisters, that in these Judicial Elections we'll win with 60 to 70 percent and with 90 to 100 percent in the peasant communities."
There have been some reports of irregularities in the selection process, as well as the question of the impartiality of Supreme Electoral Tribunal President, Wilfredo Ovando, who was discovered to have strong ties to the MAS party from his recent campaigning during the re-election of Morales.
Twitter user Gastón (@ gastulas) is skeptical about the candidates' independence and tweets:

Tunisians embark on an historic day today.
It is election day where they will head to the polls to elect a national constituent assembly, which will be responsible for writing a new constitution, and forming a new government.
All eyes will be fixed on Tunisia today, in what is considered the first democratic test for the so-called Arab Spring.
Around 11,000 candidates, among them seven bloggers are competing for 218 seats in the assembly.

Computer science legend Dennis Ritchie died on October 8, 2011 in his home in New Jersey at the age of 70, leaving behind a legacy of enormous impact on global development.
Ritchie was the developer of the C programming language, one of the most widely used programming languages of all time.
According to Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing on October 12, one of the first to report the news publicly was Canadian software engineer Rob Pike via Google +. Like Ritchie, he is known for his work at Bell Labs.
"His pointer has been cast to void *; his process has terminated with exit code 0."
The official blog of Taxgedo (a web application to make word clouds) used the words from Ritchie's seminal textbook "The C Programming language" to create a word cloud as a tribute, and wrote:
He is the Father of C, without him Operating Systems (Windows, Apple) wouldn't be here; Games, Programs, Apps on your Apple, Android, wouldn't exist.
Anyone who hasn't studied basic programming (with some version of C as their first object-oriented programming language) might find it hard to grasp the importance of such a modest and private person.

He focuses on the characters, dialogues, music and storytelling, and through his telling, he gives us a new perspective on how a blind person perceives such a visual medium. In this video review, there are parts where the screen goes black while the audio continues which really helps the viewer understand how movies play out for the blind. This next video is his spoiler free review of X-Men: First Class.
However, setting up a DVD player that was sold to him as accessible proves to be a bit more complicated than he thought.
Things don't get any easier since using paper money requires a whole lot of organization and trust so that people actually give him the right amount of change since in the US, there is no way for the blind to tell bills apart:

This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet.
Hello World!
In this edition of the Global Voices Podcast we discuss languages that are hard to find on the internet.
Do you speak a language that is hard to find online?
Are you from a place where your mother tongue is not widely spoken?
Then you may be a part of large number of people around the world who speak and write "under-represented languages".
We also look forward to the 11 Eleven Project on 11 / 11 / 11.
New dialogue on preserving languages on the internet
The good news is that here on Global Voices, we are seeking news ways for people to use citizen media to strengthen and enjoy under-represented and indigenous languages.
Eddie Avila is the director of Global Voices project, Rising Voices.
He told me how he came to explore this subject and how he is working with New Tactics for Human Rights and others to get the discussion going.
In our interview Eddie mentions the amazing work of Kevin Scannell.
Kevin is a professor of mathematics and computer science at St. Louis University in Missouri, USA.
He told us how he got into the field of mapping Indigenous tweets and micro-blogs around the world.
Phones to help solve India's language challenge
Using a mobile phone to access the web in an under-represented language is still less than simple.
But the internet is filled with people who are willing to take on challenges like this to make our digital world a more inclusive place.
One of our Global Voices authors Aparna Ray pointed me in the direction of Shubhranshu Choudhary who works with CG Net Swara, a community radio on mobile phones in India.
He explained how this service helps people who do not communicate in more widely spoken languages.
A Quechua language podcast
There are many really interesting initiatives online that can help us all explore under-represented languages online.
Christine Mladic is the program administrator at the centre for Latin American and Caribbean studies at New York University and is involved with a podcast series called Rimasun that highlights and makes use of the Quechua languages.
A day to remember
As this is the November edition of the Global Voices Podcast, it means we are just ahead of the date, 11 / 11 / 11.
This is also special day for anyone participating in the 11 Eleven Project.
Danielle Lauren is the creative director and she explained what is about to happen and how we can all get involved.
Some of the people of Earth that Danielle mentions are also Global Voices authors, and ambassadors for the Eleven Eleven project, so I asked Salman Latif in Pakistan and Lalatiana Rahariniaina from Madagascar to share their hopes for the day.
We're also on...
That ’ s all we could fit into the podcast for this time.
But there is good news!

Qatar today announced it will hold parliamentary elections in the second half of 2013. The announcement was made by the Qatari Emir Shaikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and welcomed by netizens, who hope that Qatar's support for the Arab revolutions is shaping a new tomorrow for Qataris. Qatari Nawaf Al Thani remarks:
@ tomgara: Qatar is so rich its 2013 parliamentary elections will also elect the parliaments of Greece, France, Libya and 19 US states.
And Mona Kareem, a stateless person from Kuwait, attempts another joke:
1988 Wins Olympic gold medal in Seoul, South Korea; also wins European Championship
1992 Wins Olympic gold medal in Barcelona, Spain; also wins European Championship 1996 Wins Olympic gold medal in Atlanta, Georgia; also wins European Championship
BlogSochi.ru, a blog pertaining to the Winter Olympic Games which will be held in Russia in 2014, shared a video of an interview with Alexander Karelin.
He is introduced as an "Olympic Champion" but in the interview his persona reflects more his current role as a state official when discussing the efforts put forth to preparing the city for the Olympics.
Notice all the different angles and methods being used to attack, shucks, fakes, snaps all accompanied by great footwork and position.
Perhaps one of those boys is the next Alexander Karelin in the making.
This post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011.
Inspired by the occupy movements taking place around the world, mainly Occupy Wall Street, and under the umbrella of the global event Occupy the World on 11.11.11, hundreds of protesters raising anti-capitalism slogans took to the streets to # occupytunis.
# OccupyTunis took place at the square of human rights in an avenue in downtown Tunis, where financial institutions and banks are crowded next to each other. Protestors in downtown Tunis.
"No to Capitalism", "Resistance Now", "IMF Leave" and "Marx was Right" were among the slogans raised by protesters. The following YouTube video features protesters marching in downtown Tunis before arriving at the square where they gathered later on, chanting "People Want the fall of Indebtedness," in reference to Tunisia's debts, "People Want the Fall of Wall Street" and "Employment, Freedom and no to Indebtedness." # OccupyTunis then turned violent when police intervened to disperse protesters.
it looks like # OccupyTunis was occupied by the police
A photo showing a little girl carrying her baby brother in the classroom created a stir online in China last month. It reflects the long-standing social problem of children left behind in rural villages by their parents.
The discussion has been harmonized on online platforms and the key term "Little brother wants to sleep" (弟弟要睡了) has been filtered away and become unsearchable in major online platforms such as Sina, Baidu and Sohu since November 7, 2011, as the discussion has become more and more political.
It has been estimated that there are about 58 million "left behind children" in China.
Little brother wants to sleep
The name of the 10-year-old girl in the photo is Long Zhanghuang, her two-year-old bother is Zhang Junjie.
Their parent are rural migrant workers working in the city and the siblings are living with their grandparent.
The class room is located in a village in Fenghuang county, Hunan province.
Image from Sina Weibo user Mian Qu, also widely available in public domain.
Blogger Shichengke explains the social and political context of the photo:
On September 22, 2011, Radio Martí host Karen Caballero moderated a conversation between City University of New York (CUNY) anthropologist and blogger Ted Henken, several Cuban bloggers including Yoani Sánchez and Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo, and Henken ’ s students.
This was a unique event for Radio Martí.
Funding and oversight for the station come from the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a United States federal agency devoted to broadcasting radio and television in countries where media outlets independent of the state are either scarce or heavily censored.
Much of Radio Martí programming is explicitly anti-Castro and supportive of US policy towards Cuba; the station is seen by many as a symbol of the political gridlock that has defined US-Cuba policy for decades.
But this particular program focused on a group of Cubans who do not define themselves as dissidents or advocate for the downfall of the Cuban government: bloggers.
The participants discussed the increasing visibility of bloggers and social media in Cuba, and the unique ways that new media is used on the island, where Internet and mobile phone penetration rates are extremely low.
Recently a video clip of a young female student at one of Zambia ’ s expensive colleges, the Zambia Centre for Accountancy College (ZCAS), having sex with her boyfriend surfaced on a hardcore pornography website (link and site name withheld) and went viral among Zambian netizens who liberally shared the link.
Zambia is a culturally conservative and Christian nation in which such a video clip is considered immoral and also illegal under the Penal Code Act Chapter 87 of the Laws of Zambia, which makes it an offense to make and distribute obscene materials. Offenders face a five year jail sentence upon conviction.
Zambia Centre for Accountancy College in Lusaka.
When it comes to issues of “morality ”, there is quite something to be said about male immunity against being tried and condemned in the courts of public opinion … and women ’ s lack of such immunity.
And so when consensual sex finds itself being categorised as a scandal, you can be sure you will hear the woman ’ s name much longer after her partner has even forgotten he was ever part of the case.
For several days now, Zambian cyberspace has been abuzz with reactions to a “sex tape ”, featuring a college couple from the Zambia Centre for Accountancy Studies (ZCAS) that has been leaked and circulated online.
Lets save the lady and we will petition the authorities to save the lady.
The only person who could have made a b (u) ck from that is the guy who stole the video and uploaded it onto the net, which i also highly doubt.
Wake up!! …
Dario Kenner reports form La Paz: "In a press conference this morning President Evo Morales said the road project his government has been determined to build will not go through the TIPNIS national park and indigenous territory.
This is a dramatic change in policy.
It comes after a two month long march by indigenous movements against the planned road that arrived in La Paz two days ago. "
A march was organized on April, 14th at Merkel square, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
This march wanted to show that women were still at risk of random acts of violence and that more needed to be done from a legal point of view to protect their well-being.
The march was organized by the Ethiopian Wowen Lawyers Association, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), United Nations Funds for Population (UNFPA) and the support of the Ministry of Justice and The Ministry of Women.
It all started whem Kamilat Mehdi walked home after dark with her two sisters when a man stepped out of the shadows and threw sulphuric acid in her face.
The Reuters article says: "Though an isolated case, the attack has horrified Ethiopia's reserved and conservative society and cast a searing light on a hidden culture of violence against women". Below is a video of the demonstration to increase awareness on this issue of women's legal protection against violence.
The posters are written in Ahmaric and advocates firmer laws on violence and sexual harrasment:
On 29 November, 2011, a crowd of about 1,000 people demonstrated near the British embassy in Tehran after Britain cut all financial ties with Iran over concerns about its nuclear program.
The gathering was peaceful, before some participants stormed the building.
This incident has reminded many observers of the 1979 attack on the United States embassy in Tehran.
A few days earlier, Iran's parliament voted to expel the British ambassador since relations had deteriorated.
Here is a video from the demonstration:
Iranian blogger, Xcalibur, advises people not to follow the official line by calling the attackers "students".
The blogger says:
For months now, social and mainstream media in Venezuela have reported a wave of expropriations of Twitter accounts belonging to users who openly criticize President Hugo Chávez.
Netizens haven noticed how certain Twitter users, well known for their critiques of the government, have all of a sudden started posting messages of wholehearted support for the "Bolivarian Revolution", or confessed to be followers and admirers of President Chávez.
The Twitter accounts affected include those of artists, politicians, journalists, writers, and scholars who openly criticize and oppose the government.
Two months ago, the group N33 published a press release (available here through Taringa) and took responsibility for the expropriations made during that time.
They confirm that they are followers of Chávez followers and that they share his ideals, but that neither he nor his government are not to be linked with their activities.
According to the group, the opinions expressed by the people whose accounts were hacked could be seen as abuses of freedom of speech and defamatory speech against the President and the State's institutions.
They also claim that they are not linked to Anonymous, a group they consider "pro-imperialist."

The Bangkok governor revealed that 470 areas in the city are affected by the rising floodwaters and evacuation has been ordered in many districts.
The water seems well contained on the main road, and it doesn ’ t look strong enough at the moment to make it much further into town, but that said, some of the small side roads have been completely submerged, as you can see.
Provinces a little further to the north, including Pathum Thani, are said to have slightly lower levels of flood water now and it is reported that life might return to normal there within ten days, although that sounds a bit like a guess.
By Thursday, we got Ploy and Ton from faculty of Architecture, Chulalongkorn university to design the usage graphics on the bag. Now on Friday, all the manufacturing of the first 20,000 pilot bags is completed.
The whole process was conducted by people who barely know each other before, people who put in both money and labour we could find at the time.

Elizabeth Rivera arrived to Global Voices in 2011 and since then has not stopped translating for Global Voices in Spanish, writing her own articles both for Global Voices in Spanish and Global Voices Online and also translating for Global Voices in English. Curious to know more about her, I decided to send her a few questions which she answered willingly.
The end result is this interview that I share with you today.
Hello Elizabeth, tell us about yourself, where are you from, where are you and what do you do?
Hello!
I am a citizen of the world that by chance and fortune was born in Mexico City a little over 30 years ago.
I live in a multicultural family and I come from one. I have lived in 6 cities in 3 countries and I hope to be fortunate enough to increase that number.
Today I am in Santiago, Chile and day to day - as well as collaborating with Global Voices - I earn my bread as a marketer.
How did you hear about Global Voices and what encouraged you to get involved in their work?
With the birth of the Arab Spring, I reactivated my Twitter account.
I started to follow interesting people who post regularly, including @ JustAmira.
I was struck by the Twitbon you had on her profile, so I came to Global Voices.
I immediately fell in love with the site, reading the posts they had and their reason for being.
I saw the link to work as a translator and said, "here I am."
Now not only do I translate but I have the opportunity to write my own pieces.
I am very proud to be part of this community and hope to remain so for a long time.
I have learnt a lot and I have met very valuable people.
Elizabeth Rivera with her little girl.
2011.
How do you have enough time to translate and write?
A little discipline, that is all.
When I take a translation I give myself a date or time limit to complete it by. I do not take another until I have finished it.
When I'm writing a post I don't do translations.
In any case, I am a quick typer on the keyboard and I'm used to doing many things at once (you know, working, being a mother, wife, writing, friends, etc, etc.):)
You said you have lived in 6 different cities, tell us about your travels!
Now that I remember, there are 7!
In Mexico I have lived in Mexico City, Cuernavaca, San Cristóbal de las Casas and Cancún.
In the United States I have lived in Irvine and Chino, both cities in California.
In Chile, only in Santiago.
Mexico City is the city where I was born and where I have my roots, my people, my identity.
I studied in California for several years and it is also a place where I feel at home because my mother's family lives there and I spent my childhood summers with them.
In San Cristóbal (or Sancris as it is affectionately known) I had the opportunity to work with a Tzeltal community producer of coffee helping them start a business that allowed them to keep the village in a sustainable way.
Elizabeth Rivera in Dublin, Ireland.
Changing topics, how do you see the Chilean student movement? Will the negotiations between them and the government reach a conclusion?
The Chilean student movement of 2011 is the second part of the "revolución pingüina" ("penguin revolution") of 2006.
Education is the foundation of any society.
It is not just a problem at the university level, the system begins to affect children since preschool.
I think both sides, government and students (or rather, society in general) want the best for the country.
This must be what prevails in the negotiations.
Now, if you want to reach a true solution, the government should stop providing "patch" answers as increasing grants or lowering interest rates, which help, but do not attack the root of the problem; and the students must understand that change does not happen overnight and must be open to options. The youngsters have lit the flame of change, now it's up to the current government to seize the golden opportunity that is in front of them to leave a positive mark in the history of Chile.
And why do you think the government does not want to compromise on the core of its educational model? There can be many reasons.
Both personal and ideological.
I think many in the government really believe that such a thorough reform is not needed (we think this is a neoliberal model of education, which is consistent with philosophy of the Right).
Others are "afraid" to change the tax laws or think that a reform would be too complicated and / or expensive.
And some do not want to budge.
The status quo is easier and more comfortable.
The new forms of media have been key to elevating the discussion and involving all citizens in this matter.
That is always good for a democracy.
Even at the beginning of this movement, they were not even covering the protests, instead giving news of anything else, while in the streets there were thousands of people demonstrating.
Elizabeth Rivera in Angelmó, Puerto Montt, Chile, 2010.
Why are you volunteering for Global Voices and not another NGO?
For me connectivity is important in every sense.
It was the reason I chose my career and why I like to travel.
The more we feel the interdependence with our fellow man and our environment the easier it will be to put ourselves into the shoes of others, understanding, respecting and opening ourselves to possibilities.
Global Voices has allowed me and allows readers to understand cultures, ways of thinking and news from other perspectives, which is very rewarding making ties stronger, and borders - starting with the language - are gone.
Finally, tell us your favourite activities when you are not working? I love traveling so I'm always imagining and planning the next "break". It is normal that my husband, my daughter and I take the bag on a Friday and return on Sunday with no problems.
We like to discover places from the "local" point of view, so we explore the markets, we ask the taxi driver "where to eat where the tourists don't go" and if there is a friend in the place, even better!
For us it is the best thing to spend money on. In fact, I live intensely by my favourite phrase: "The world is too interesting to stay in one place all the time." I also like reading, especially historical novels but since my baby was born I have not had much time to devote to reading.
Thanks Eli! And to show you how true that is, our Latin America Regional Editor Silvia Viñas hopped over to Elizabeth's house for a brief chat: ()

Ever since the company Reñaca Concón S.A.
(Reconsa) started its efforts to build a real-state complex on the delicate and unique ecosystem of the Concon Dunes neighbors began their struggle to prevent this development.
On December 27, 2011, their worst nightmare became a reality: the construction company began erecting a fence around the protected area.
But they weren't alone this time; the Chilean cyberspace was filled with protests against the closing and construction of up to 20 luxury apartment buildings in the zone, thus adding to the claims made by the 50 neighbors that protested at the building site.
Twitter user @ Perro _ del _ Lucho warned:
University of Economics in Bratislava (EUBA) has recently signed a contract to acquire electronics and software for its Faculty of National Economy for a total price of over 1.8 million euro.
Many of the items are overpriced (see the contract here).
For example, one MacBook would cost the university over 9,000 euro, despite the fact that it was not the latest model (and, to be accurate, the price of "9,000 euro for a MacBook" also covers a 24-inch Apple LCD display, an external keyboard and a mouse - normally, all together, it would cost 3,000 euro or so - plus an extended service contract).
According to media reports, the university feels no problem with such a contract, explaining that the prices are the result of a public competition, and it was enough to offer the lowest prices to win it.
pressburgerzwilsonova1: they behave like those in this classic joke: two Slovak nouveau riches meet in Paris and one asks: how much did you pay for that jacket? - 250 euro. - You are stupid, they have it for 450 next door! medofil:

2011 has been an extraordinary year for online content.
Global Voices has been there as revolutions happened, dictatorships fell, and network effects rippled through the cities and neighborhoods of our contributors reporting from around the world.
To celebrate what ’ s been an extremely exciting year for us, we, along with our friends at Morningside Analytics, have created a limited-edition poster that visualizes “attentive clusters ” of bloggers who link to Global Voices and cite similar online content.
The resulting image portrays the scope of the Global Voices community, and turns it into a work of art that commemorates an important year in the history and impact of citizen media.
The poster is available to anyone who donates US $25 or more.
Reserve yours today through this link.
We ’ ll be mailing out posters in January 2012.
Even if you don ’ t want a poster, we ’ d love your support.
Regular donations are tax-deductible in the U.S, and can be made through our Donate page.
And please also be sure to share this post with your networks! Global Voices is a volunteer community of over 500 writers, translators, and digital media activists who bring you underreported stories and conversations from around the world.

A community of enthusiastic young people in Beirut, The Migrant Workers Task Force, are working to support foreign domestic workers in Lebanon whose living and working conditions are often desperately unfair.
The volunteer group has only been active since January 2011, but already they have managed to attract the attention of both local and international media for their innovative approach to changing the perceptions of both workers and employers.
Among their main achievements are the free language courses they offer to workers learning Arabic, English, or French every Sunday.
In Lebanon, approximately one domestic worker a week dies under murky circumstances (often described as "suicide").
Eighty percent of domestic migrant workers are not allowed to leave their employer's house at all.
Their plight and rights are almost universally ignored.
Initially the task force consisted of only Alex, Lioba, Farah, Ali, and Janie and a few other members, but recently the group has been expanding.
According to Janie Shen, 24, one of the co-founders (the only foreigner one who is actually still in Lebanon) the idea for the Migrant Workers Task Force was born after newcomers to Lebanon, like herself and Alex, were shocked by the conditions of migrant workers in the country - for instance, the degrading uniforms, general mistreatment, having passports confiscated, food rationed, and only one day a week off or none at all.
In this video Janie explains more about what the Migrant Workers Task force is about:
Migrant Workers Task Force have no office or official organization, but have been meeting regularly at Zico House in Hamra and will soon relocate some of their activities to Migrant House in Nabaa. Everyone involved in the project is a volunteer, and they rely on small fundraising events to cover their costs.
'You see a poor man, but he is a source of wealth' Anti-racism ad by Migrant Workers Task Force
Among their memorable campaigns are, their anti-racism posters for International Worker's Day (featuring three language class students), a series of interviews with migrants about their conditions, and some short satirical films in response to an official campaign showing Lebanon as a paradise for tourists.
They have also hosted local migrant celebrations, like a Nepalese New Year celebration, and have helped sell African and Asian food and other migrant products.
Language classes
On Sundays workers from Nepal, Philippines, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Sudan assemble to learn languages with volunteer teachers who wish to help. They began as informal gatherings, but are now developing into more structured language lessons.
Here is a video from the languages lessons one Sunday and some testimonies of students and teachers.
One teacher says, "I am offering my skills in English to let them speak for their rights."
The language classes have become an important venue for community building.
One student interviewed in the video below is Rahel Zegeye, a migrant worker from Ethiopia, who over two years put all of her earnings towards making a feature film about the experience of domestic workers in Lebanon.
In less than a year, Migrant Workers Task Force has mobilized more volunteers and goodwill than many other more established organizations.
Via language and communication, they have helped migrant domestic workers in Lebanon facing a very local problem gain highly deserved international attention.
The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT) has recently released a 15 minute film titled World Without Torture that focuses not only on the importance of preventing torture, but also the importance of documenting it and providing rehabilitation for torture survivors. The film features the case of Khaled Said.
Founded in 1798, Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Hospital - named after Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov - is one of the oldest hospitals in Ukraine.
It is also one of the first state medical institutions to use social media.
The person behind the creation of the country's first public hospital Twitter (@ MechnikovaBoln) and Facebook accounts, is a tech savvy epidemiologist and blogger Mykhailo Sukhomlyn (@ mvsnotes, mvsnotes.blogspot.com).
However, this is not his first attempt at running a social media account for a state medical institution.
Social media enthusiasts
Sukhomlyn and his wife - programmer Tetyana Cheshko (@ tvnotes) - used to work at a regional sanitary and epidemic department.
Both being social media enthusiasts, they set up the institution's Twitter account, which was used for timely internal exchange of information amongst the department's staff.
Mykhailo and Tetyana also admit that they are frequently approached by Twitter users with health and medical questions.
After becoming Dnipropetrovsk Regional Hospital's Chief Information Officer, Sukhomlyn decided to apply his successful experience there and launched its social media accounts to share news about the hospital, including events, employment vacancies, arrival of new equipment, etc.

In an interview to Dnipropetrovsk TV Channel 9, Sukhomlyn explained that the administrators use the hospital's account to tweet about the services provided by the institution, while encouraging Facebook uses to discuss their quality on its official page.
For instance, one of the first issues raised by the patients included long waiting lines at the hospital.
Other medical personnel at the institution are also using Twitter.
Last month, the hospital shared their Twitter list and encouraged others to follow:
Global Voices
Hello World and welcome to 2012!
We also set off on a two-wheeled journey around the internet!
Considering 2011
For citizen journalists, bloggers and commentators everywhere, 2011 has been an extraordinary year.
It ’ s hard to imagine a time before now when our friends and contributors faced threats, arrests or violence on such a scale. Nor has there been a year so far when we have seen such influence and change in the sphere of online citizen media.
For many of our own writers and friends here on Global Voices, times are still difficult, but let's have hope for perseverance and better times ahead.
Looking back over a year of Global Voices Online is no mean feat!
Our deputy editor, Emma Brewin, talks about jumping into a wild torrent of global news, and which stories stood out for her during an extraordinarily busy year.
From mainstream to new media
The Global Voices regional teams are made up of writers, bloggers and media makers of mant different types.
Some, like Thiana Bondo, a Global Voices author and translator from Bahia, Brazil come from a journalistic background.
Our managing editor, Solana Larsen chatted with Thiana, who is currently based in London, about the differences between being a daily newspaper journalist in Brazil, and writing for Global Voices.
Supporting the indigenous web in Bolivia
In December, Rising Voices hosted a three-day event in Cochabamba, Bolivia for bloggers in Bolivia.
The goal was to support the development of a stronger, and more diverse blogosphere.
There were workshops and presentations on both technical tools and organising strategies.
The meeting was in Spanish, and was called Conectándonos (getting connected).
Maria Mercado is a student and a volunteer who works with indigenous communities.
She went to the meeting and told us what she learned.
If you'd like to hear more, there is a wonderful podcast of the whole event on Rising Voices by our managing director Georgia Poppellwell, and Rising Voices director Eduardo Avila.
You may think that we are separated by distance and only connected by the internet, but it seems that we also have some healthy habits in common.
Ever prepared with her recording device, Solana Larsen discussed the wonders of getting around by bicycle with Global Voices executive director Ivan Sigal.
As Ivan explains, the online cycling community is a vibrant one.
Naturally this meant that I had to ask our stunt-cyclist-audio-contributors to share with us their thoughts on two wheels.
Cyrus Farivar an American journalist currently living in Germany, and the author of "The Internet of Elsewhere" chatted with us about cycling - directly from the seat of a bicycle.
In Denmark, Maria Grabowski Kjaer shared the sounds of the city where cycling is celebrated.
Cycling for Maria is not just a mode of transport but a way of life.
Well, that wraps it up for our first podcast of the new year.
We ’ ll be chasing audio and chatting about the world ’ s news and habits online throughout 2012, so do stay tuned and always let us know what you ’ d like to hear.

This post is part of our special coverage Global Voices in 2011.
Every time a year comes to an end, evaluations of it are made. Sometimes we tend to be very objective and other times, subjectivities float to the surface.
Some members of the team of translators at Global Voices in Spanish, who during the past twelve months have worked behind the scenes to translate the best of what Global Voices Online publishes in English on a daily basis, decided to briefly express what we liked the most or what impacted us the most of what we have translated or seen posted. And as we say colloquially, let's put the 'floro' (palaver) aside and get to the point:
I found very moving and creative the way egyptians took a very "simple" and ordinary thing as a street wall and converted it in a canvas to express their thoughts about revolution and to pay tribute to the martyrs, claming the street as theirs.
We want them to know that their texts not only inform, but also generate sentiments, discoveries and awareness in all the readers.
Mexico Wake Up!
The violence and impunity Mexico has been facing these past years have prompted artists, creators and media to join forces and launch a campaign to change statistics into names and stories.
Through a collaborative project they are asking viewers to research other casualties and give voices to the victims of violence.
Artists have recorded several videos telling some of the stories of people who were murdered in Mexico.
For example, singer Ely Guerra recorded herself speaking as Marisela Escobedo, a mother who fought to see justice for her daughter's death.
Although her daughter's husband confessed to killing his wife, the authorities declared that there wasn't enough evidence.
Marisela Escobedo was murdered in front of the Justice Palace, where she was protesting and rallying for justice for her daughter.
Both Marisela and her daughter's murders are still unpunished.
The full story in English can be found in the video's description:

Global Voices This post is part of our special coverage Global Voices in 2011.
My name is Victoria Tinta and I would like to briefly share my experiences with Global Voices:
I started to translate for Global Voices Aymara in 2009, and at the time, I only translated one article per month regarding topics such as politics, sports, education, environment, and others.
But since I started as editor, I no longer translate just one article, but rather more than five articles per month.
I translate all of these articles during my free time, and each post takes one, two, or even three hours each, depending on the post's length. By translating and editing, I have been able to learn about events taking place in other countries. Among my translations, there is one that caught my attention: Languages: Let's Tweet and Speak in Quechua.
For me, it was an interesting topic to translate and this is the translation in Aymara: Aymara: Arunaka: Tuytiyañani ukatx qhichwat arsuñani.

I am very happy to be a volunteer translator, and I am very motivated to continue the work.
I would also like to congratulate the translation team from Global Voices Aymara. ¡Nayraqatar sarantasipkakima! Keep up the good work!
Irma Silveria Laura Apaza writes:
I started to translate articles for Global Voices in Aymara beginning in June 2011, and I've always been interested in things related to languages. I think it is very important to value the Aymara language, and to spread knowledge of this language throughout the internet so that other people can become interested through the translations.
One that really caught my attention was Slovakia: The Most Expensive Apple Computers and in Aymara: Eslovaquia: Apple cumputaduranakax sinti jila chaniniwa.
Some may not be interested in the topic, but university students have the latest technology for their studies with no regard to the cost of the computers. Having a computer is no longer a privilege, but rather a necessity.
The majority of students have netbooks, and as is the case in some countries, many professors are behind when it comes to technology.
Martha Valencia Intimayata writes:
My participation with Global Voices in Aymara started in 2010 to the present, and through this translation work, I learn about what is happening around the world.
Over time, I have translated interesting topics including one that really impacted me, which was: Iran: Female Blogger Receives 50 Lashes and the translation: Aymara: Irán: Bloguerax phisqa tunk jawq ’ aw katuqatäna.
How could a blogger receive 50 lashes just for providing information? That is very unjust.
Victor Paco Montevilla writes:
Personally, I started to translate at the beginning of last year.
First of all, it gives me great satisfaction to be able to contribute to the Aymara language on the internet, especially through Global Voices Online.
In regards to my translations on Global Voices in Aymara, I consider it benefits Aymara speakers and the language itself, as its status grows considerably by being online.
The topic that impacted me the most was related to the help received by the humanitarian aid workers during and after their rescue work for the Japanese earthquake: Japan: Aiding the Aid Workers and in Aymara: Japón: Japunan yanapt ’ irinakar yanapt ’ asa.

I started to translate for Global Voices in Aymara since February 2011, as it has already been a year. It is interesting that by translating one becomes informed about important issues taking place around the world, and for me that is very important. The topic that most impacted me was: Zambia: Netizens Start Countdown to 90 Day Change Promise and the translation in Aymara: Zambia: Cibernautanakax 90 urun mark turkakipañ amtawitx niyaw jakhuñ qalltapxi I will continue to translate because I really like to translate into Aymara.

It all started when my colleague Ruben cordially invited me to be part of the Jaqi Aru project.
I didn't think twice to be a part of the initiative, since at the time I was looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge acquired during my university studies. At the beginning, I started by publishing posts in Aymara.
Soon, I learned how to use the tools on the Global Voices in Aymara platform, which was very interesting, but a little complicated.
I translated about a dozen articles written in Spanish, French, English, and Aymara. I have been taking part because I love translating from different languages.
Even more, if it deals with contributing to the native language, and above all, to be able to share the same knowledge with society through the internet.
Among those articles, the one that interested me the most was: “Mexico: Celebrating Cantinflas' 100th Birthday ”.
I chose the topic because I am a fan of the famous comedian, and I wanted to learn more about his life and career. I learned a lot by translating the article.
To begin, I placed myself in his place, I felt, and learned that he did not become famous overnight, but rather it was a process full of virtues and sadness.
In the Aymara language, there are certain limitations compared to other languages, especially regarding vocabulary. However, those challenges are being overcome little by little.
Some of the topics that were missing from the site included posts about Christmas, New Year Celebrations, Carnaval, and others, which is something that I would like to explore.
Honestly, I would love for Global Voices authors to continue to publish more and new content, which would give me more options to choose from in order to translate into Aymara.

“If regular people are not coming back to Russia, then why would scientists do so? ” Global Economy Matters Blog argued that some of the efforts made by the Russian government to address these demographic issues have been successful, quoting a Population Reference Bureau article in May 2011:
The crisis, as it was seen to be, was definitely noticed, but nothing really effective was done until 2007 when Vladimir Putin announced a baby bonus of the equivalent of $9,000 for second and further births. Putin has been an outspoken advocate for raising the birth rate and improving health conditions in order to avoid the consequences of sustained very low fertility.
“We ’ re losing almost three quarters of a million people every year, ” said Alexey Komov, chairman of the Moscow Demographic Summit that was held this last June. The post included a video produced by the Population Research Institute, which argued that government programs aimed at curtailing demographic decline date back to Caesar Augustus of Rome, but that all such programs invariably fail:

Singapore's government ministers are some of the highest paid in the world, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong famously earning more than Barack Obama, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy combined.
Although the government has often defended the high salaries, saying that it attracts the best talent and prevents corruption, their pay packets have gained the resentment of many Singaporeans, further fueling accusations of the divide between the governing elite and the people. High ministerial pay was a hot issue in the 2011 General Elections, and after the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) won with their lowest vote share in history, Prime Miniser Lee convened a committee to review ministerial salaries.
The president, who used to earn more than the prime minister, will now earn less at about S $1.54 million (approximately US $1.2 million). Although Singaporeans were pleased to hear that the government is set to accept these recommended cuts, many still noted that Singaporean leaders are still among the highest paid in the world.

The Water March that set off from Cajamarca on February 1, 2012, continues on. After a warm welcome in La Libertad region and more support from farmers, fishermen and ecologists on passing through Ancash, the March is now approaching Lima. Meanwhile, various independent journalists and foreign websites are talking about and giving their opinions about the March.
For example, El Ciudadano, PiensaChile and Mapu Express of Chile, the Agencia Latinoamericana de Información, Rebelión, Infolatam are all reporting on the March. In Lima, however, some media are revealing alleged political reports that denounce the March organisers as "reds and extremists" and "experts in the mobilisation of masses".
In the previous post we left the March on its fifth day, leaving Chimbote and headed for the city of Casma and then on to Huarmey.
From there they continued on to Paramonga, which now belongs to the Lima region, where they spent the night.

Slow Internet and filtering is a daily reality in Iran, but in recent days reports from inside the country say that web email and secure Internet (https:) has become inaccessible, and that the Internet is so slow that anti-filtering software fails to open web pages.
The partial blackout began on Thursday, February 9, 2012.
While Iranian authorities have been silent, some bloggers speculate that the reason for the blocking is a planned protest on February 14 (in the Iranian calendar, 25 Bahman).
The Tuesday protests will mark the one year anniversary of demonstrations called by Iranian opposition leaders in 2011, in solidarity with the people's uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.
The physical repression on this day was brutal and left at least two people dead in Tehran.

This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis. Just a few days after the brutal police crackdown at the Luis Vives Institute of Secondary Education in Valencia, students have again been the target of beatings, pushing and violence from the police at a pacific protest in which they were, precisely, demonstrating against police violence.
This time, the crackdown started on the afternoon with unexpected force.
The chief of Valencia Police himself has referred to the protesters as "the enemy", even though they are youngsters from 12 to 17 years, all secondary school students.
Reactions from # 15M social movements were quick to denounce the crackdowns against minors and ask for an investigation and for the political and police leaders to immediately stop the repression of minors and the participants of the pacific gatherings. About 400 university students have locked themselves up in the Universidad de Valencia (Valencia University) as a form of protest.
And in anticipation to the police crackdown inside the University, the Dean has denied access to the forces of "law and order" that attempted to dissolve the protest, basing her decision on the principle of university autonomy.

An advertising campaign run by Singapore's Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) has come under fire for perpetuating prejudice and discrimination against ex-offenders, victims of abuse, people from the low income strata, and people with disabilities.
Words such as "ruined", "destroyed", "abandoned" and "hopeless" have been highlighted.
These ads have been widely criticised by Singaporeans, who felt that they were offensive.
As a father of a special needs child, I am deeply offended by this kind of messaging.
I am not at all suggesting that these individuals do not need help but our assistance should stem from a communal desire of mutual assistance rather than a need to help “objects of pity ”. The Society for the Physically Disabled did not comment specifically on the ads, they expressed happiness that MCYS was doing a campaign" to attract people to the profession. "Some see these ads as representative of attitudes towards disability – both of this region as well as of the Singapore government:
In response, the MCYS spokesman clarified that the word "hopeless" in the poster did not refer people with disabilities, but to the sense of hopelessness that they feel about their condition.
The ministry said that the campaign was simply trying to encourage more people to take up social work as a profession.
Demonstrations and public acts, led by both coca growers and traders, took place on Monday, March 12, 2012, in many cities in Bolivia demanding the international depenalisation of the coca leaf.
Local media informed that 40 thousand people were due to join "coca-chewing day".
These public events are part of the Bolivian government's international strategy for depenalising the coca leaf, and took place at the same time that President Evo Morales, himself a former coca grower and union leader, was addressing the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Vienna, Austria three years after his last visit.

Coca is a native plant to the Andes.
It has been cultivated and consumed for centuries in the region.
It is used for medicinal and ritual purposes, and is also well known as a natural energy supplier.
Popular tradition, particularly in the Western part of Bolivia, considers coca a "sacred" leaf.
In spite of its nutrients and the traditional consumption, coca leaves are also the raw material for cocaine production, a fact that the Bolivian government acknowledges and pledges to deal with.

Two prominent Kurdish websites were taken down earlier this morning, and have been unable to send updates regarding the clashes.
In addition to this, mainstream news sites have been slow in covering this story, which is why Kurdish activists have used social networking sites to raise awareness.

This year, the struggle of the indigenous Ngäbe-Bugle have become more visible than ever before, thanks to social networks. In February, as Ariel Moreno reported on Global Voices, members of the Ngäbe-Bugle community had blocked the Pan-American highway to protest against mining and also "to demand that the government comply with the agreement reached last year with respect to mining in the region." Ariel later wrote:
The blog Prensa Ngäbe-Bugle explains:
The rain in Peru has not stopped.
Due to the heavy rains during the months of February and March in much of the highlands and Peruvian jungle, now there are floods in the lower parts of Peru, mainly in the regions of Loreto and Ucayali.
Several weeks ago, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (Senamhi) of Loreto gave warnings of the high levels that the Huallaga, Ucayali, Marañón and Amazon rivers had reached. And although some authorities had taken measures, it wasn't regarding the expectations of flooding.
The Regional President of Loreto only requested a state of emergency when the list of injured persons had reached 40,000.
The central government finally declared a state of emergency when the number of people affected rose to 100,000.
The floods have affected the normal development of classes in schools situated in the lower zones of the region.
Classrooms have had to be improvised and now take place in local neighbourhoods and residences where the students arrive to class in small boats known as peque-peque.
This is shown in the following photo which was shared by Twitter user @ PacoBardales, and which belongs to reporter David Gonzales. The photograph was taken at the school N · 601536, in the country house Nuevo Campeon, Itaya river, Belén.

Tunisian netizens have expressed their anger at a ban on protesting on Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis, the capital's main street and the Tunisian equivalent of Cairo's Tahrir Square.
On March 28, 2012, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior banned any kind of protest, claiming complaints had been received from commercial and touristic businesses located on the avenue. Recently skirmishes between Islamists and liberals occurred when two protests took place at the same time on the same street.

They say Habib Bourguiba Avenue is banned...
What's this...
He went on to call for a protest: @ slim404: The state of emergency ends tomorrow, March 30, in Tunisia.
Go protest!

The documentary Runa Kuti, Urban Natives shows us the stories of four descendants of indigenous communities living in the city of Buenos Aires, and how they struggle with reclaiming their identity, rediscovering their culture and making a place for themselves in the city.
http: / / vimeo.com / 32219379
The film focuses on several descendants of indigenous groups who all live in Buenos Aires.
Through their stories they share how they were raised sheltered from their own roots as their parents decided to shelter them from the exclusion and discrimination by not teaching them their indigenous language or customs, others grew up in ignorance of their ancestors origins, and how they have decided to embrace their tradition and culture as a way to empower themselves and take pride in their heritage.
Runa Kuti, Urban Natives, produced and directed by Paola Castaño and Dailos Batista Suárez, has been shown in several film festivals around the region, and in a push to get the message out to the greatest quantity of people, they have released it under a Creative Commons License.
They explain on their 12 March, 2012, blogpost:
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
The previously featured Creative Commons documentary Runa Kuti on the identity of urban dwelling indigenous descendants in the city of Buenos Aires is looking for volunteers to help them subtitle the documentary into indigenous languages found in Argentina such Quechua, Aymara, Mapuche and Guaraní as well as into English.
On their blog they've posted their call for volunteers:
"What we're trying to do is gather information and spread it, so that people can get correct understanding of what village life in Armenia is like," explains the text accompanying a promotional video for Թիմը գնում է գյուղ (Tim goes to the village), otherwise known as Straight to the village. The first episode went online on 20 September last year and takes a look at two villages close to the border with Turkey whose income is based on fruit production.
In the latest installment uploaded to YouTube on 2 April, and subtitled in English and Armenian, Straight travels to the impoverished town of Vardenis close to Armenia's Lake Sevan. The purpose of the visit is to meet with a local NGO working with disabled children.
On 12 March, the program celebrated its 20th episode with an interview with Straight where he "talks about some of the highlights and explains the reason why he does the program and the potential long-term effect of the show." Knighted by the King of Norway in 2010, Straight's involvement in regional development in Armenia is not limited to the video reports.
Homeland Handicrafts, for example, is a voluntary organization dedicated to creating a sustainable income for artisans in Armenia. Particularly using online tools, a blog as well as Facebook and Pinterest pages are also used to promote the initiative.

The Indigenous Territory and Governance Platform is made up of a series of institutions all working together to provide the indigenous people of Latin America the tools and resources to be able to strengthen the governance they have of their territory and their community.
A series of short videos is used to document their progress.
In Colombia, the Association of Indigenous Councils to the North of the Cauca (ACIN) brings together more than 14 reservations and 16 indigenous councils, and through their efforts, the indigenous communities have started taking control of their own economy and environment through small businesses that produce dairy products, fruit juices, cane sugar, bread as well as the commercialization of these products to stock the community stores as well as help other social projects in the community.
Through barter systems, training and centralization of products, they mean to provide food security for the indigenous communities as well as provide sources of income.
In Ecuador, the Kichwa of Pastaza have a territory of 1 624 778 hectares (4 014 913.87 acres) belonging to 131 communities.
For several years already they've sustainably managed this area, in the next video they share their experiences in developing a Territorial Management Plan based on zoning for a system that will enable them to live off the land without depleting it for many more years while also taking advantage of their constitutional rights to make use of their own lands.
So far only these two videos in the series have been released.
Lets hope more are forthcoming in the future focusing on the experiences in other Latin American countries.
The Ecuadorian version of the blog Conectándonos ("getting connected") announces the upcoming gathering in Loja, Ecuador on May 24-26.
Rising Voices and a local university -the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL) .- are co-organizing this event which aims "to promote integration and participation of groups and individuals from underrepresented sectors."
The first Conectándonos gathering was held in Bolivia in December 2011.
The Els nous pobres blog collects testimonies of poor people affected by the crisis which has greatly limited their economic and personal opportunities. According to the authors, the intention is "to give faces, names and surnames to social injustice we have been living in while our public representatives have been sharing shameful wages, favors, subsidies and privileges of all kinds."
Hundreds of people across the whole island joined the "National March: Puerto Rico stands firm against the Pipeline" that took place on Sunday 19 February, 2012, in the city of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. The demonstrators marched from the Capitol (the Legislature) to the Governors Mansion (La Fortaleza) in rejection of the so-called "Green Way," a project proposed by the administration of the governor Luis Fortuño, which is looking to build a 92-mile-long tube to carry natural gas from the south coast of the island to San Juan, on the north coast, through the central mountain range.
The march was organized by the community organization Casa Pueblo based in the town of Adjuntas.
Casa Pueblo has led the attempts to put a stop to the so-called "Green Way".
Environmentalists have argued that, if the project goes ahead, it would have a negative impact on the aquifers and rain forests on its path, causing irreparable damage to the island's ecosystem.
Grassroots organizations and people against the construction of the pipeline have called it the "Pipeline of Death."
Photojournalist Ricardo Alcaraz shares some of the images he shot of the demonstration.
All photographs have been published with his permission.
People from all sectors of civil society joined the demonstration.
The protesters marched from the Capitol to the Fortaleza.
In the background you can see the west side of Olympic House, the headquarters of the national Olympic committee.
Various sectors have complained that the project would cause serious damage to the flora and fauna of the island.
Several endangered species live on the proposed pipeline route.
Congressman Luis Gutiérrez also joined the demonstration.
There were a number of performances along the march.

The tallest peak in Costa Rica is the Cerro Chirripó, at 3820 meters (12,533 feet) above sea level.
Throughout the years, it has drawn many locals and foreigners to climb up to the summit: these next few videos bring us two very different experiences.
One of the first expeditions back in 1960, and a modern day hike to the top.
In the Hikes of Courage: Climbing Chirripó in 1960 documentary, a team of young men and women set out on a lengthy expedition to reach Costa Rica's tallest peak.
This expedition was special because it was only the second time reaching the summit was documented through signatures on a mailbox left at the top: those signatures would be evidence for the next mountaineers that the previous team made it to the top.
Also, it was the first time women were documented reaching the summit.
Narrated by one of the expeditionaries, meteorologist Rodrigo de la Ossa, the story is full of anecdotes on the journey which is now done through another, shorter, path.

Currently, the hike up Chirripó is about 19.5 Km long (12.1 miles), with a mandatory overnight stay near the summit at a lodging station.
This next subtitled documentary uploaded by tetsuo1337 shows their experience climbing up to the summit in 2010.
As a protest against discriminatory state policies and arbitrary arrests, the stateless community in Kuwait (Bedoon) decided to light candles in their houses and post pictures of them on Twitter.
The idea was suggested by blogger 7anthala Al-Bedoon who thought it would be a message to the authorities that "the struggle is going on and that their peaceful objections will not end until they get their rights".
On Wednesday 4 April, a flood of pictures went on Twitter as people expressed themselves variously with candles using the hashtag # شمعة _ حرية _ وأمل meaning "a candle of freedom and hope".
Here are some of the pictures shared:

However, it takes extra courage to be part of smaller protests, where there are fewer people to defend each other and less media to report a possible crackdown.
So what about a single protester conducting a sit-in on her own, like the one in this image?
Zainab Alkhawaja is seen in the above image protesting on her own on April 21, outside the Financial Harbor in Manama, the Bahraini capital.
He has been on hunger strike since February 8, 2012 to draw attention to his detention and mistreatment, and recently netizens around the world expressed their great concern over his deteriorating state.

Zainab, who tweets as @ angryarabiya, has been detained since yesterday.
Her sister Maryam AlKhawaja reports that she has refused to go to the public prosecution.
It is worth mentioning that this was not Zainab's first arrest, nor the first time she stood her ground alone.
I'm still wondering how she has such courage, but I guess nothing can answer my question better than what she has written as her Twitter bio: When ur in chains, living with no dignity or rights, bowing to criminal dictators, the first step is to forget ur fear & realize that its ur right.. to be angry This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011.
A group of young women in the slums of Hyderabad in India are learning how to make videos to change their communities, and in this next film the group of young girls explain what they've learned and how they are helping their communities and themselves through their work.
Namita Singh, who is doing her PhD research on participatory video had a double function in this process.
An experienced trainer in video production for grassroots communities as well as a writer of toolkits and guides for media training directed to girls and children, she was also studying these girls learning process. While producing the video documenting the girls progress, they asked her to please train them further while they made the film.
She comments on this experience in her blog post 'Namita Singh, the Trainer Vs.

Bolivia: Development at What Cost?
This post is part of our special coverage International Relations & Security.
A proposed road project in Bolivia that plans to cross right through the middle of Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro Sécure (TIPNIS for its initials in Spanish) is once again generating conflict and protest. Indigenous organizations, TIPNIS inhabitants and their supporters began a new long march on April 27, 2012, from Trinidad to La Paz demanding an end to the road project.
Plans for the 306 kilometer road are the result of an $415 million agreement signed by the Presidents of Bolivia and Brazil in August 2009.

In October 2011, after a large march of indigenous peoples and protestors arrived in La Paz, President Evo Morales passed a bill declaring the TIPNIS “intangible ” or“ untouchable ”, which was understood by environmental campaigners and indigenous organizations as the final word on the issue. However, in February 2012, Bolivia's government gathered pro-road supporters and supported a different march that proposed a new law calling for "prior consultation" that would allow indigenous peoples a greater say.
Indigenous inhabitants of the TIPNIS - supported by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB) claim that such constitutional mechanisms should have been conducted before any agreement or contract was signed.
Morales eventually announced the cancellation of the contract for the road with the Brazilian company OAS at the beginning of April, but protestors still reject the terms and conditions of the proposed consultation. A large number of indigenous organizations and citizens acknowledge that Evo Morales - an indigenous and coca grower's leader himself - has improved their situation.
Still, indigenous organizations emphasize that their protest is about their right to be consulted before policies concerning their territories are implemented.
This video shows interviews with indigenous TIPNIS residents and their views on the road project.
The environmental impact of the road is another issue sparking protests, particularly among Bolivia ’ s urban and middle classes.
Nevertheless, Bolivia's government insists on the benefits of a road that would link the central zone of the country, beginning from where most illegal coca is produced and where Evo Morales garners grassroots support.
Coca-grower organizations are openly supporting the road as it may provide opportunities to expand production into the TIPNIS National Park.
Inevitably, this generates further suspicion among environmentalists, international organizations and public opinion.
Debates also continue on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter (under the hashtag # TIPNIS).
One of the questions simply asks “are you in favor or against the road # TIPNIS? ”
Among the replies was:
“I think the country must be integrated, if is … best to go through the TIPNIS, so be it, the road should go through where is the best for Bolivia. ”
Criticisms are also leveled at the relationship between the road project and the Brazilian-supported Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA), a development plan to link South America's economies through new energy, transportation and telecommunication projects.
According to researcher Gustavo Soto's post on the CEADESC blog:
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
Multimedia web channel TodoLoQueHay (All There Is) from Colombia recently posted a short visual journey in the Emberá-Chamí indigenous reserve previously known as Christendom, whose inhabitants are now trying to make known by its ancestral name instead: Karmata Rua.
Street artists and musicians broaden their public when they come into contact with citizen media.
In Venezuela, where music and theater are parts of daily life, traffic, and buses, a number of citizen journalists share their experiences when they meet with artists that bring color to urban life.
Similarly, these very artists prepare short videos and documentaries in which they show performances of various street musicians.
In this video, recorded by the artists themselves for the festival of street singers, you can see musicians that come together in various cities throughout the country:
Meanwhile, Cinetica13 shares a very popular street musician's performance in the city of Mérida.
Theater also has its place in the Venezuelan street art world.
On his YouTube account, Perucho Morales shares performances by the "Comediantes" group, also in Mérida.

On May 2 and 3, 2012, a series of Web 2.0 workshops were held in the Department of Oruro in Bolivia.
These workshops were organized by the Ministry of Education and the Jaqi Aru Project, which is comprised of a group of linguists in the city of El Alto, Bolivia. This group has been promoting the use of the Aymara language on the internet.
Many of the volunteers from Global Voices Aymara also form part of Jaqi Aru.
Education professors from the Teacher Training Superior School (ESFM for its initials in Spanish) took part in the workshops, and the event's objective was to help the professors and their students begin to create digital media content in the Aymara language.
According to the planned program, the workshops took place in the following schedule:
On Thursday, May 3, the workshop began at 9: 30 am in the conference room with an opening presentation by the facilitators from Jaqi Aru.
Following this presentation, Mario Duran Chuquimia gave a talk about Web 2.0 and Wikipedia.
In the afternoon, hands-on workshops took place in the computer lab, where each professor worked on an individual computer with an Internet connection.
Martin Canaviri provided a workshop about social networking sites, focusing on the use of Facebook, and Ruben Hilare shared his experience in the use of Twitter.
Finally, Victor Paco Montevilla, gave a presentation about the use of the photograph sharing site Flickr.

On Friday, May 4, Elias Quispe spoke about blogging on WordPress, and Edwin Quispe introduced the participants to Skype.
Hilare later presented a workshop on Wikipedia Aymara.
The workshop ended in the conference room with a short evaluation, in which the professors gave thanks to the members of Jaqi Aru and the Ministry of Education for organizing the workshops and for the training sessions. Many participants said that they were motivated to create content using these new technologies.
Professor René Chura Quispe from ESFM Mariscal Andrés de Santa Cruz Calahumana, located in the Department of La Paz, said:

On June 3, 2012, about 65 girls were rushed to hospital after being poisoned at their school in the northeastern Afghan province of Takhar. The incident was the latest in a series of attacks against schools for girls in the province.
On May 29, some 160 girls ended up in hospitals after a gas attack at their school. Earlier this spring, more than 270 girls were poisoned in anti-school attacks in two different locations. Overall, hundreds of girls throughout the country suffered in similar attacks last year.
Officials have blamed the Taliban for these incidents.
Between 1996 and 2001, when the fundamentalist movement controlled most of the country, females were banned from going to school.
Although millions of girls have enrolled in school since the ousting of the Taliban, the movement's fighters and their sympathizers continue punishing female students for seeking education.
Young schoolgirls lie unconscious on the lawn of a hospital in the capital city of the northern Takhar province after being poisoned at their school.

The Taliban has denied its involvement in the anti-school attacks. Yet, they can hardly convince anybody.
They must also punish for wanting to learn. They deny involvement in these attacks, but their own history — in which many girls were not even allowed to go to school during Taliban rule from 1996-2001 — suggests that educated women go against the Taliban ’ s interests. Responding to Erica, another American blogger, Katherine Lorraine, explains:
Educating women is the quickest and easiest way for true equality among the sexes - so naturally the all-boys' club of the Taliban wants nothing more than to hold women down and force them to live at the lowest rungs of society.
For the sake of these girls, the Afghan government must make the safety of its students a priority. Afghan blogger Hussain Ibrahimi writes:
A gang of 15-20 young supporters of Golden Dawn, the startlingly successful Greek neo-nazi political party, attacked an approximately 30-year-old Pakistani man on May 29, 2012 in Athens, in the metro station of Agios Nikolaos, a neighborhood known for its large immigrant population.
Golden Dawn supporters hold flares in Thessaloniki, Greece on election day (May 6) when the party won 7% of the vote.

The gang entered the station shouting fascist slogans like "You will never become Greek!"
They targeted the man, threw him on the ground and beat him, as shocked passengers looked on.
In a TVXS news report, an eyewitness narrates the story and explains what happened when he reacted to the brutality of the group:
On the heels of United States (US) President Barack Obama's support for gay marriage, Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro and Director of the country's Centro Nacional de Educación Sexual (National Center for Sex Education), is visiting the United States; during her stay, she has been addressing gay rights activists, but her trip has not gone over well with some bloggers. Diaspora blogger Alberto de la Cruz, writing a babalu, felt:
She is a prisoner of her lineage and I barely have a past to look at, right now I just wake up thinking about tomorrow.
She will have to recognize that I exist, I am, that this Sanchez demands her right to criticize the follies of its windmills.

Protesters fighting to save Lake Urmia in Iran from permanent environmental damage have not given up.
On May 21, 2012, once again people in Urmia and several other cities in the Azerbaijan region of Iran have called on the government to save the dying Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest salt water lakes.
In Khoy (photo above) protesters hung a banner on a bridge saying "the death of Lake Urmia is the death of Azerbaijan."
One blogger published a cartoon saying "Let's save Lake Urmia with our tears."
Here are a couple of videos shared by Iranian citizens of demonstrations in Urmia.
Heavy security presence
Police strike back
The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is believed to have thousands of detainees who were not allowed access to trials and many of them do not even know their charges.
The families of detainees have been working the past months through social media to spread the word and have finally decided to take their cause to the street. @ e3teqal, an account on Twitter, published information about the protest right before it started to avoid a heavy security turnout.
Days before the protests, the account posted this invitation which showed drawings of detainees the way the Palestinian prisoners were symbolized in a late social media campaign:
The account also posted a photograph confirming the participation of the detainees' children in the protest: The protest happened in Sahara Mall in the capital Riyadh and another took place in Al-Qasim region.
Those are few pictures of the Riyadh protest posted by the same Twitter account mentioned above:
This picture from Al-Qasim protest was posted by @ e3teqal too:
Sign reads: Haila Al-Qasir was sentenced to 15 years in jail for calling for justice, is that fair?
We stand in solidarity with our brothers in Riyadh; we could not come because our male guardians are in jail.
News of arrests was published online soon after the protests.

The painful story of Iranian bloggers has a new face these days: Hossein Ronaghi Maleki, a jailed blogger who is serving a 15-year sentence in prison. His father says jail has been a torture because of his poor kidney condition.
Hossein began a hunger strike on May 19, 2012 for a simple reason: to have the right to stay in hospital after surgery and not to move back to prison. His health condition deteriorated, and he was eventually moved to a hospital.
Adam Evolution says of Hossein Ronaghi Maleki: He is not a singer, he is not football player, he did not get naked and he is not an actor.
He just fought for free access to the internet. He is 27 years old, sentenced to 15 years in prison, he spent ten months in an isolation cell, he was operated five times and lost one of his kidneys.

On July 1, Mexicans went to the polls to elect their next President.
From before the elections, the sentiment among most netizens was that it would be a close race between Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) from the Party of the Democratic Revolution, although supporters of Josefina Vázquez Mota (from the current ruling party) did not lose hope.
As soon as the polls opened, netizens began to share their thoughts and experiences.

2011 was a tumultuous year for the African continent with revolutions, attempted coups and violent political crises.
Unfortunately the union of 53 African states that has as its mission to help strengthen regional peace and development has proved its own shortcomings in dealing with these situations.
The African Union, created in 1999 after the dissolution of the Organisation of the African Unity, was unable to solve the Côte d'Ivoire post-electoral crisis, offered late support to popular movements of the Arab Spring, and its position on Libya was primarily determined by the late Colonel Gaddafi's influence on the organisation. All this has led many African citizens to distrust whether the Union is really able to fulfill its mission.
In light of the events in Tunisia, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Kenya, Madagascar, RDC, Libya and many more in Africa an institution that should be boycotted and toppled down to the ground is the African Union.
The embarrassing Ali Baba gang of 53 thieves is useless in solving any or all the conflicts in Africa or finding any unifying consensus. (...)
In the unfolding crisis in Mali, the organisation currently appears to be faring no batter.
Although worrying reports are coming from the Northern part of the country, now ruled by Islamist group Ansar Dine, the African Union failed to mobilise the United Nations Security Council to back a military intervention with troops from the countries of the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS). On a France-based blog of a Touareg association, Temoust.org, it is explained:
The 3rd Edition of the Tve Biomovies 1 minute environmental film competition has begun.

The decades of war and terrorism have placed Afghanistan among the world's most dangerous countries.
Despite the progress made by the country since the ousting of the Taliban in 2001, most media writing about Afghanistan focus stubbornly on negative issues such as bomb blasts, suicide attacks, and casualties.
But generally those images tend to be more about the negative side of the conflict there. Pictures of flag-draped coffins driving through Wootton Bassett or out of Brize Norton... a picture of a soldier smiling, but the caption underneath giving the date he died.
Sadly, the majority of the British population that supports the lads and lasses on the ground have no real insight into the story of the war out there; the story that is Afghanistan.

A gas tank exploded at 1 am today, August 25, in the Amuay refinery in Judibana, Falcón state. The explosion has left at least 26 dead (media from Falcón report 35 deaths) and 86 injured.
Most of the casualties are members of the National Bolivarian Guard.
Amuay is Venezuela's most important refinery, and one of the five largest oil refineries in the world.
The reasons behind this accident are still unclear.
Gabriela Gonzalez (@ gabriela2400), a doctor and neighbour living in the area, told Venezuelan journalist Nelson Bocaranda that the refinery's alarm system was activated half an hour before the accident and then turned off.
A problem marred Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) power handover to the newly elected 200-member General National Congress in a recent ceremony: The master of ceremony was the unveiled female presenter Sarah Elmesallati, who was ordered to leave the stage after an Islamist MP walked out of the ceremony in objection to her presenting the historic ceremony.
Netizens have gone to Facebook to record their objection or support.
According to reports, Islamist MP Salah Baadi of Mistrata objected to Elmesallati presenting the event and yelled at her to cover up.
He then walked out of the ceremony in protest. Then, an assistant to NTC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil asked her to stop presenting.
When she refused, Abduljalil himself signaled her to stop, which she did.
She was replaced with a male presenter.
Screen shot of the We are all Sarah Elmesallati Facebook page
In response, a Facebook page entitled We are all Sarah Elmesallati was formed.
The page is being used to debate the status of women in post-Gaddafi Libya as well as hurl insults at and support for the young female presenter.
Also, on Facebook, this image is making the rounds:
An image showing Abduljalil shaking hands with an unveiled Hilary Clinton
It shows a photograph of Elmesallati and Abduljalil shaking hands with United States Secretary of State Hilary Clinton.
It reads:
Presenter Sarah Elmesallati is thrown out of the ceremony because she is a woman who does not wear the hijab and because she is Libyan.
Abduljalil said: "We are a Muslim conservative society and we are people who celebrate our religious teachings and have customs and traditions.
Hilary Clinton is a woman who doesn't wear the hijab and she is also what you call an infidel.
When you shook her hand, did you say that it is forbidden for a man to shake the hands of a woman?
Is this a religious teaching? Or is it an American tradition?
The image has been shared more than 250 times, and has attracted around 730 comments on the We are all Sarah Elmesallati page on Facebook so far.
We need to admit that the problem is with society as a whole, and that if this society did not allow for such discrimination, no one would dare commit such actions.
Meanwhile, Libya Now, also on Facebook, writes an open letter to Elmesallati, after she defended herself in an interview.
In one part it says: I have personally not spoken a lot about Sarah Elmesallati's case before and used to say "She had to be advised in another way."
However, after watching her interview in this video, I have completely changed my mind.In this video, the conceited Sarah Elmesallati says that she knows that the hijab is ordained by Allah and she also said "This is something between me and God."
She also said Allah had ordered the believer to lower his gaze but had not ordered him to advise women and ask them to wear the hijab.
The writer continues:
She also said we are a moderately religious state and I personally put two lines under the word moderate.
No, Sarah!
We are a 100 per cent Muslim country and you should review and fully comprehend your expressions, which you have communicated to this channel, before uttering them
Heavy rains caused catastrophic flooding in many regions of Senegal on August 26, 2012, with 18 dead and 42 injured so far. The Senegal government has launched a rescue plan with French emergency organisation Orsec to assist victims.
Senegalese internet users have described the consequences of flooding in their regions.
Meanwhile blogger Anna Gueye made a compilation of striking photos published on twitter and Claude André Coly told of the difficulties facing inhabitants of other regions:
On August 28, 2012, Bolivian authorities seized two tons of solid material, presumably uranium or radioactive minerals, that were being transported from a property at a central district of La Paz, close to a number of diplomatic offices, under no security or protection measures.
Minister of Government Carlos Romero led the operative, which was conducted by special police units.
Later, Mr. Romero informed that laboratory tests and analysis determined that the material was “not radioactive.
It will not produce any risks ”.
However, Romero also announced further investigation by the Geologic and Mining National Service Sergeotecmin and the Bolivian Institute of Science and Nuclear Technology.
The potential radioactivity of the material remains therefore unclear.
Police seize 2 tons of uranium in Sopocachi, La Paz, on August 28.

Mainstream media reported on the event immediately and covered it throughout the day. Concerns and comments, including ironic ones, were also expressed on social media sites under the hashtag # uranio.
Blogger and journalist Andres Gómez Vela commented via his Twitter account (@ andrsgomezv):
Some 45-50 people living in makeshift shacks in the abandoned woods alongside Fehér Road and Terebesi Road in the capital of Hungary, Budapest, were called upon to leave their homes at short notice in June 2012.
Some of the residents, who have been living in their shanties for decades, have built up self-supporting farms, while some have been trying to make their living from collecting and selling scrap-iron.
Rumours spread years ago that the city was planning to build a recreational park in the area.
Residents told atlatszo.hu's journalists that social workers from the Red Cross and the Baptists informed them about the eviction and offered places in their shelters.
Civil rights movement A Város Mindenkié (The City is for All) criticized the forced eviction as illegal and noted that people would be provided with worse housing than the existing one.
Albert Jónás, a shantytown resident.
Photo by Atlatszo.hu.
Kettős Mérce blog wrote about the case in June: One after another, the municipalities are announcing various decisions of destroying shanties, meanwhile they can ’ t provide an alternative to them.
These people are not lazy, most of them work and they have built those shanties themselves, where they — even if modestly — live.
The homeless shelters offered as alternatives, however, wouldn ’ t provide them with the opportunity of leading an independent life, but would only integrate them into the system forever.
Today in Hungary there ’ s no such housing policy that offers an opportunity to start an independent life, so people are building these shanties and trying to create outside of the state frameworks.
A Város Mindenkié held several protests in June against the forced eviction of the people from that area. (They shared photos of the 'Terebesi woods' here.)
On their blog, they wrote that the municipality provided two weeks to local social workers to find a place for these 50 people.
They noted that homeless shelters were not proper alternatives, since the homeless can only spend up to two years there and without any income they, again, wouldn't have a place to go to.
Atlatszo.hu ’ s investigation has shown that social workers were asked to “solve this problem ” by the District X municipality to help a real estate investment.
As Deputy Mayor Tibor Weber informed atlatszo.hu ’ s journalists, investor Sidi Group ’ s plans to build 900 apartments, offices and some recreational areas are now in an advanced stage of authorization.
Civil rights protests and increased media attention appear to have prolonged the eviction, which now seems to have turned into a lawful and negotiated procedure.
Many of the inhabitants have moved out to shelters, some are still staying there, but the process is unstoppable for now.
Neighbors of the Mata Redonda community, in the Venezuelan city of Maracay, are using citizen media to denounce a possible natural disaster if the contention wall that separates the zone from Lake Valencia were to collapse.
The discussion started after a video posted on YouTube and its dissemination across Twitter and Facebook.
This also brought the issue of the pollution of lake Valencia and the lack of sanitation work back to the table.
During recent days, several videos have been shared that point out the possibility of an environment disaster.
Potential solutions and prevention measures are also being discussed on citizen media.
Many families are worried that they won't have a place to shelter in case of flooding and others are raising the alarm after feeling unheard.
User Ruckyto published the video that netizens are sharing:
Hostos comments:
Bolivia's former Minister of Defense, María Cecilia Chacón, wrote a note on her Facebook account, which was later reproduced by mainstream media, breaking the silence almost one year after her resignation. The young former minister left President Evo Morales' cabinet only hours after news broke about the violent police intervention to the 8th Indigenous March in defense of the National Park and Indigenous Territory Isiboro Secure (TIPNIS in Spanish), on September 25, 2011.
Ms Chacón published this note just as Sacha Llorenti, former Minister of Interior, was appointed as permanent ambassador to the United Nations (UN) based in New York City.
During the police intervention to the indigenous march, Mr Llorenti was on duty as head of the police and as the authority directly responsible for safety.
María Cecilia Chacón's note on Facebook
Among the noteworthy parts, former minister Chacón said:
Hulunbuir Grassland, located in the northeast of Inner Mongolia, provides beautiful scenery of vast grassland, forests, rivers and lake where the Mongolian shepherds herd their cattle and sheep.
It is also a famous tourist site.
However, as a result of coal mining near the surface of the ground, the grassland is eroding rapidly.

On September 12, 2012, a Shanghai based micro-blogger, Baoyi, posted a number of photos in his Weibo and urged others to pay attention:
This is the second part of a three-part series about water-related problems in the city of Iquitos, Peru.
Click here to read the first part.
In our first post we briefly introduced some water-related issues in Iquitos, and later presented the controversy generated by the transnational Conoco Phillips and their exploration and search for hydrocarbons in the Nanay River basin.
Speaking on the issue, researcher Gonzalo Tello recently reflected on the actions of Conoco Phillips in his article "El Agua Sagrada" (The Sacred Water):
The key issue is that C P is an environmental steamroller given carte blanche by the FTA with the United States in the sense that, as they have already been awarded concessions, with the reference terms of an operations plan approved by the Peruvian government (despite the many serious holes under the environmental waterline that History should punish or at least hold morally accountable), this oil consortium is "protected" by the FTA to execute, no matter what, its plans, at whatever cost, without anyone from the government opposing them, under the current legal penalty of the binational instrument.
"The Nanay River, Loreto, Perú."

The issue has been a political taboo since the United States extractor ConocoPhillips stealthily moved into the region two years ago, despite laws of the Loreto's Regional Government that prohibit industrial activity at the mouth of the Nanay River.
Despite these laws, the government has been entirely complacent with ConocoPhillips since 2010.
Informants point out that a gag order from the government and the run-down local media have kept this agreement outside of the public radar until the beginning of this year.
With respect to legal efforts by the Comité del Agua (Water Committee) of Iquitos intended to force the publication of impact studies, he adds:
The results will only be shown if ConocoPhillips' employees believe they have found oil and will finally present the reach of their project to experts, activists and to the general public - something that the regional Government has been desperately, however seemingly through illegal means, trying to avoid.
It is not only the Regional Government that has an arguable role in these events; according to the weekly publication La Verdad (The Truth) from Iquitos, it is laughable that the Management Committee of the affected area is presided over by "Perúpetro (who gave the concession) and has a Conoco Phillips representative as vice president."
Moreover, the Congress' Commission of Andean, Amazonian, Afro-Peruvian Peoples, Environment and Ecology announced plans for a decentralized meeting in Iquitos to analyze the general issue of ConocoPhillips' operations in the Nanay River basin.
However, the Water Committee wanted to go further and planned a trip to Lima for some of its members as part of a "civic crusade for the defense of the Nanay" with the goal of gaining the public's support and exhausting all obstacles in reaching a dialogue. Given the limited resources managed by the Committee, they organized a cebichada (fundraiser selling ceviche) to cover some of the costs of the commission to Lima.
That same day in September, the spokespeople for the Water Committee met with one of Conoco Phillips' shareholders who was visiting Iquitos.
The committee reiterated their position of defense of the Nanay River basin and their demand for cessation of all oil activities in this area.
Seamus Finn, the Conoco Phillips shareholder, took note of this and said that he would present the issue in the next shareholder's meeting in New York City on October 5.
Those concerned over the Nanay River now await the results from the actions by representatives of the Water Committee in Lima, on September 24 through 27.
Original post published in Juan Arellano's personal blog.
This is the third and final part of a series of three posts about the water problem in the city of Iquitos.
See the first and the second.
In the first post of this series, we introduced some water-related issues in Iquitos and the controversy generated by the search and exploration for oil in the Nanay river basin.
In the second post we delved deeper into the case of Conoco Phillips, and also show the actions being taken by organizations like the Water Committee to protect the river and Iquitos' water supply.
In this third post, we will focus on the monocultures of the Nanay river and the problem this is causing between those who support this type of crop and those who advise against it.
The struggle for water in Iquitos is not without risks.
José Álvarez, a researcher for IIAP (Peruvian Amazon Research Institute), published an article entitled "Monocultures in the Nanay?
No thanks ", wherein he discussed IIAP's reasons for advising against the cultivation of palm oil in the Nanay basin, especially in the Curaca stream basin, a tributary of the Nanay, adjacent to the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve. Allpahuayo Mishana Reserve, Nanay basin, Loreto, Perú.
Some of the reasons are: - The Nanay basin is the supplier of potable water for the people of Iquitos and surrounding villages, and any serious alteration of the vegetation cover could jeopardize the provision of this vital element, both in quantity and quality.
The commercial palm oil plantations, apart from involving the clearing of large areas of native forests, require high inputs of agrochemicals and therefore mean a serious threat of water pollution. - The areas where there are plans to establish palm plantations are covered entirely by nearly untouched old growth forests which have experienced minimal and selective extraction of timber species and wildlife.
It is the policy of the Peruvian government, and a formal commitment to the international community, to protect old growth Amazon forests, as a measure to reduce carbon emissions and to help mitigate the impacts of climate change.
But it seems this was not appreciated by some, who organized a group, supposedly "peasants" from the area, who came out to demonstrate in favor in cultivation of "palm oil" and attacking José Álvarez, carrying signs that read things like "trafficker of natural resources" and called for his expulsion from the national territory.
In a statement in support of the researcher, a group of citizens of Iquito say that in talking to the demonstrators, they said they were told that Álvarez "was to blame for not promoting the cultivation of palm and that government loans had not been approved for this purpose" which suggested that the source of these attacks might be close to the regional authorities.
Not all opinions are against the cultivation of palm oil in the Nanay basin. The economist Víctor Villavicencio la Torre, who served as Regional Manager of Economic Development of the Regional Government of Loreto, is in favor, and writes:
It is imperative to adopt or establish a regional political position regarding the promotion and encouragement of a crop that, having proven to be very profitable, may very well be an alternative for hundreds or thousands of villagers to get out of poverty, struggle and misery thanks to the alliance between the state and productive investment.
This alliance should take out of the political game these non-governmental organizations that receive and administer money coming from countries which, let's face it, are the first to threaten the environment and biodiversity of many nations in the world.
He then reiterates what he argues should be the role of the State:
The State should set an immediate goal to revise laws regulating farming and forestry, in order to root out these "limosine liberal" environmentalists, and stop being passive spectators to the aggressive actions they take. Let's find some common ground so we can avoid rural people, tired of so many promises of change, ending up setting the prairies on fire and bringing back to the collective memory the fateful events of Cajamarca, Espinar, Madre de Dios and Bagua.
Is that what we want?
Instead of silly protests and shrill cries, let's applaud for palm oil, which will be like applauding for Loreto.
However, just in the 30 years I've lived on this land, I know that the promoters of the failed model of extractive agricultural development, who we will call "underdevelopers", have not spent tens of millions but billions of soles: failed agricultural projects, salaries for staff and consultants, unproductive agricultural infrastructure (cassava flour mills, rice mills, milk factories, bottling of palm, etc.) The big question: Did anyone prevent them during those years from promoting agriculture and livestock in the forest, without restrictions, in the communities of Loreto?
He adds: But their ineptitude was not free: thanks to these budgets and projects, "underdevelopers" have filled their pockets with commissions, travel expenses, bribes, records, consulting, advisories, cushy bureaucratic positions, feasibility studies, business plans, investment plans, blueprints, projects and per diems, without coastal or indigenous peoples having any improvement in their quality of life; rather it has deteriorated. But businessmen continue to be very interested in the business opportunities presented by the 620,000 hectares (approx.
1.5 million acres) in the Loreto region, which according to the Minister of Agriculture are available for planting, and they are doing outreach in this respect. Moreover, academics and researchers continue to provide data and studies about the dangers of palm oil cultivation for the fragile Amazon ecosystem.
They claim that companies are even promoting the consideration of palm oil plantations as a reforestation activity, as well as the government incentives given to that crop.
Even President Ollanta Humala in a recent press conference mentioned an Amazon area, the Alto Huallaga, as a "potential for agribusiness, for coffee, for cocoa, for palm oil, for planting fruit trees."
As can be seen, there is no clear consensus among the stakeholders involved about what the policy should be on these issues that affect everyone. On one side are those who promote large-scale investments and on the other, those who defend the environment. Compounding the problem is the fact that dialogue about the matter doesn't exactly abound, and neither does clear and transparent information that citizens need.

On Thursday, September 20, 2012 the Mexican president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto, started a visit to Chile, the fourth country in his first tour across Central and South America.
After a private dinner with President Sebastián Piñera, the next morning he had a meeting with Chile's main businessmen and later he paid an official visit to the Moneda Palace.
Peña Nieto thanked President Piñera for the hospitality on his Twitter account (@ EPN):
@ EPN: I thank President @ sebastianpinera for his hospitality and productive meeting. Our relationship with Chile will continue to be strategic.
Nonetheless, not everything was conferences, handshakes and protocol.
Members of the # YoSoy132 movement in Chile denounced the arrest of six of their peers - one of them from Mexican origin – for protesting at the Moneda Plaza against the visit of the President-elect.
Meanwhile on Twitter, Chilean netizens welcomed the next Mexican leader with the hashtag # VetedeChilePeñaNieto ("leave Chile Peña Nieto"). Mexican netizens answered back to this hashtag, creating an exchange that turned the hashtag into a trending topic.
Here we collected some of these responses:
The Chilean Max Barata (@ MaxBarata) joked:
Image shared by @ YoSoy132chile on Twitter @ MaxBarata: Piñera and Peña Nieto.
While Chascas Valenzuela (@ elchascas) imagined how the encounter between the two leaders could be: @ elchascas: A dialogue between Peña Nieto and Piñera must be like a humor sketch.
The two of them talking about poverty, helicopters and golf at the same time.
The parody account of journalist Carmen Aristegui (@ Aristegui _ CNN) was direct:
@ Aristegui _ CNN: # VetedeChilePeñaNieto No! Make him stay there!
You can have him for free!
To what Alonso Damian (@ AlonsoDamian) from Iquique, Chile answered:
@ AlonsoDamian: @ Aristegui _ CNN no thank you!
We can send Piñera over if you want
From Mexico, the Judicial and Human Rights Committee 132 (@ ComiteDH132) made this comparison:
@ ComiteDH132: If anything, the only difference between pinochetism and priism is that here, in fact, it was the perfect dictatorship... # VeteDeChilePeñaNieto
Meanwhile Gaby (@ Gigi _ 091) denounced:
@ Gigi _ 091: The protests in Chile against Peña Nieto are not news for Televisa?
But a blackout at the Congress is...
And Enrique J. Bautista (@ kmach02) from Tabasco, Mexico spoke about the bond that some netizens from both countries felt through this online protest:
@ kmach02: # VetedeChilePeñaNieto and that day Chile and Mexico felt they were more brothers than ever... they are fighting for education and we are fighting against the imposition
More and more believe that the weekend anti-Japan protests in more than 80 cities are state sponsored.
The arrest of three protesters in Shenzhen who were peacefully demonstrating in the middle of thousands of anti-Japanese protesters yesterday demonstrates how the police officers were effectively and selectively controlling and managing the protests.
According to citizen rights NGO news website, canyu.org, three human rights activists were arrested in September 16, 2012, during the anti-Japan protest:
(Canyu's news brief on 16 September 2012) This morning, the grand anti-Japan rally took place in the Shenzhen downtown area, around Huaqiang North and Citizen Center. Shenzhen democrats such as Jiang Weidong, Ziyuan, took the chance to express their aspiration for freedom, democracy and human rights.
They joined the rally, holding a banner with words: Freedom, Democracy, Human Rights and Constitutional Rule.
They were discovered by undercover security police and arrested at around 1 p.m. They have been out of contact since then. Their phones are disconnected.
Please pay attention to this!
Our contact phone number is 15167233712
Three Shenzhen citizen rights activists are protesting for democracy in the anti-Japan rally. They were quickly arrested by undercover police.

The above piece of information somehow echoes with C Custer's observations about the police's role in the anti-Japan protest:
Like many people around the world, I ’ ve spent some of the past few days looking at photos and reports about the escalating anti-Japan protests in China.
There is an excellent collection of them here for those that are interested... for anyone who has been to a protest in China before, your second inclination is going to be to say this: where are all the fucking cops?...
Now, let ’ s compare that to photos from the Beijing “Jasmine revolution ” protest, an incident so small that it not only didn ’ t have any car-flipping, burning, or rioting, it didn ’ t even have any protesters.
There was an army of police there...
The evidence that China is turning a blind eye to these protests is overwhelming.
The absence of China ’ s police forces is glaringly obvious, especially in contrast to the vast numbers that turn up and start jumping in front of lenses and smashing cameras whenever a protest China ’ s government doesn ’ t like is scheduled to take place.
China has clearly shown it is more than capable of keeping anti-Japan protests under control if it wants to.
The obvious conclusion now — the only conclusion now — is that it doesn ’ t want to.
Carlos Eduardo Valdés Moreno, director of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, reported that there were 28 violent deaths in Colombia on October 2, 2012: "a day in Colombia usually means 79 violent deaths for the country, so we have lowered violent deaths in Colombia from 79 to 28, for a total of 51 deaths less."
On October 2, 2012, and as part of the International Day of Non-Violence, several Colombians beckoned other citizens to celebrate 24-0, an initiative that aims to hail this day as one free from any violent deaths. José Ignacio Navas explains the origin of celebrating International Day of Non-Violence:
With a campaign of 24 hours without violent deaths, Colombians celebrate the International Day of Non-Violence, which is held every October 2 in accordance with what has been established by the United Nations.
In this way, the international organisation remembers the anniversary of the birth of the pacifist leader Mahatma Gandhi, who headed the movement of India's Independence and was a "pioneer of philosophy and non-violence strategies".
While the website of the initiative describes the aim of the day: 0 violent deaths on October 2:
Advertisement 24-0
"Our goal is 0 violent deaths because we have already achieved it, 0 violent deaths in 24 hours is definitely possible.
The information provided by the National Police in Colombia confirm: during 2011, 3 local councils registered between 7 and 21 days without any homicides, 29 between 170 and 298, 757 up to 364 days and 333 local councils registered the whole year, 365 days, with 0 homicides.
So what do we want the statistics to be in 2012? To achieve, together, 0 violent deaths within 24 hours across all local councils nation wide. "
Through Twitter several citizens relayed, in real time, what was happening and expressed their optimism for the initiative.
The musician César López (@ CesarLopezmusic), one of the initiative's leaders, published:
@ CesarLopezmusic: Our children will be able to say many things about us, but they cannot say that we never tried. @ 24 _ 0 @ 24 _ 0Guatemala @ 240puertorico
The actress Carolina Guerra (@ carolinaguerram) expressed her wish: @ carolinaguerram: JUST FOR TODAY # 24-0 Tuti Furlan (@ TutiFurlan) wrote:
@ TutiFurlan: Today, before demanding # Paz ("peace") I have to check that I am giving it, if I am living it, if I am promoting it in every step I take! @ 24 _ 0
In Bogotá, with the participation of various artists and musicians, both national and international, an event was put on that could be followed via streaming.

This post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2012. On Sunday, September 30, Henrique Capriles supporters rallied en masse in the streets of Caracas during the presidential candidate's closing campaign event.
Henrique Capriles is running against current President Hugo Chávez in the upcoming presidential elections on October 7.
Daniel Duquenal wrote in his blog Venezuela News and Views:
As I put in a tweet that has been re-tweeted a few times, I dare anyone to prove me wrong that there has not been in the electoral history of the Americas a event of such amplitude.
I can assure you of one thing, from past experience in Venezuela, today Capriles has put AT LEAST a million and a half people in the streets of Caracas. for hours people tried to come and go, or just walk a portion of the different set routes.
The Libertador, the Solano, the Miranda, the San Martin avenues were full, and more. For hours.

This post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2012. Reporte Ya (@ reporteya), a training initiative by Foundation Miguel Otero Silva, has released a handbook focusing on the use of Twitter for citizen reporting during the upcoming presidential election in Venezuela on October 7, 2012.
The handbook is available online, in PDF format, on the website of newspaper El Nacional.
The handbook -written by journalist, blogger, and Global Voices contributor Luis Carlos Díaz- states:
On election day, social networks will reflect our spirit of participation, but they will also serve to record what happens in almost every corner of the country.
Therefore, it is important to have some criteria to cover and follow the elections.
The objective of this handbook is to present some premises to reduce noise and rumors, to produce reliable information, and to connect with each other through networks for citizen reporting.
Twitter handbook for citizen election coverage
The handbook focuses on key questions like, "Why will we use Twitter?", "How do I upload photos / videos to Twitter?", "How do I monitor information during the election?", "How do we avoid rumors?", and more.
It also instructs citizen reporters in case of communication failure, listing three possible scenarios: a collapse of mobile networks, a collapse of the Twitter platform, and a blocking of Internet access.
To answer the question "What hashtag will we use?", the handbook recommends using # 7O or # EleccionesVE, "although they will change throughout the day depending on discussions and reactions from Twitter users to the electoral events."
For more tips on how to cover the elections, check out "Tips for monitoring" by Sabrina Segovia in El Nacional.
President Hugo Chávez held a final campaign event in Caracas on October 4.
Despite the rain, his followers filled major avenues in central Caracas, waving flags and cheering as they showed their support before election day on October 7.
The English language version of El Universal reported:
delivered a 32-minute speech in which he underscored the message he has delivered in his previous campaign events: that he is the candidate for the future and that "the life of Venezuela is at stake."
We feel blessed by God with this rain.
It is the prelude of what is going to happen on Sunday.
Chávez is to win on October 7. "

Turkey's military has attacked Syrian targets in response to the killing of five Turkish civilians by Syrian government forces.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's office issued a statement immediately afterwards, saying:
Our armed forces in the border region responded immediately to this abominable attack in line with their rules of engagement; targets were struck through artillery fire against places in Syria identified by radar.
The Turkish parliament has passed a year-long mandate which approves cross-border military action.
The motion was passed by 320 votes in the 550-seat Turkish parliament.
Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister has said in a statement that authorising the use of force in Syria does not amount to a declaration of war, but acts as a preventive measure.
This was followed by a statement from Turkey's Prime Minister, who said:
All we want in this region is peace and security.
We have no intention of starting war.
We are aware of the outcome, consequences, of war in Iraq and Afghanistan... we see the same in Syria.
The state-run Syrian News Agency (SANA) released an immediate statement saying Syrian authorities are offering sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and the Turkish people.
More than 5,000 protesters took to the streets of Istanbul against a possible war with Syria.
On Thursday night, the demonstration was against AK party, protesters chanted:
The AKP wants war, the people want peace.
No to war, peace right now.
Cherine Atalla tweeted this picture from the protest, which reads "Hands off Syria": A sign at the Istanbul anti-war protest which reads Hands off Syria, shared by @ Cherine _ 89 on Twitter.

In Turkey, the slogan Savasa hayir, which means "no to war," became top trending topic among Twitter users on Thursday morning.
And since the cross-border military action mandate has been approved, social networks have been divided on the issue, creating a firestorm of opinions from activists, pundits and the like.
From Turkey, Hulya Ataoglu tweeted:

On October 10, 2012, President Laura Chinchilla signed a decree that strengthens the controls on shark finning in Costa Rican waters.
Although shark finning is illegal in Costa Rica since 2001, some gaps in current legislation allow the sale of shark fins.
The aim of the decree is to outlaw the import of shark fins to the country in order to avoid the sale and export.
The announcement was received with great joy by environmentalists, NGOs and hundreds of citizens who had sent letters to the Executive Power of the Republic to raise awareness of such painful practice.
As expressed by Carol Corrales in a post for Rainforest Radio:
Shark finning is a cruel and devastating practice where sharks are mutilated to extract their fins, and then returned to the sea without them, where the animal dies after suffering a desperate agony

Positive comments reacting to the President signing the decree are visible on Twitter under the hashtag # NOALALETEO (“No to finning").
Such is the case of Marianela Castro (@ necascru) who tweeted: @ necascru: # noalaleteo Zero tolerance for finning!
But this is not the only good news in the field of wildlife protection for Costa Ricans.
On October 2, the Legislative Assembly approved the first reading of a reform for the Wildlife Conservation Law, which proposes the elimination of hunting sports in the country.
The project was sponsored by the Association for the Preservation of Flora and Fauna (Aprelofas) and if it is approved in the second debate, Costa Rica would be the first nation in Latin America to criminalize this practice.
This project was supported by the citizens with up to 177,000 signatures in a petition that formed an important endorsement for the law.
Under the motto "Hunting is Killing," a large number of supporters joined the popular initiative, which is the first one at a national level to reach the Congress.
The blog “Generación Rebelde ” (Rebel Generation) describes the event as“ a party for wildlife ” and finishes its post with a statement:
“We celebrate it.
And we will be vigilant so that any attempt to invalidate the law are discarded and so that it is observed to the letter. ”
Congressmen who opposed the law in the first debate received strong criticism.
As Susan wrote in Maecr ’ s blog:
"In Costa Rica, killing wildlife to eat? Perhaps in the Stone Age.
The issue of sport hunting and hidden interests relies between big words where they are probably trying to hide it. National Elections are approaching, maybe most of the people do not feel it that close, but it is important to think and wisely decide who would we rather grant power to, who will just comfortably sit there, with good salaries, to choose and decide for EVERYONE else "
Tweets about the law can be read under the hashtag # LeydeVidaSilvestre (Wildlife Law).
"Hanging Around".

Security forces in Tehran on October 3, 2012, Source: Greencity
No shops were open in Tehran's Grand Bazaar on Thursday, October 4, 2012, one day after shopkeepers and merchants went on strike to protest against the free fall of the national currency on Wednesday.
Iranian netizens published several videos of Wednesday's protest gatherings, the presence of security forces in the Bazaar areas, and closed shops.
Kalmeh, an opposition website reports that several protesters were arrested on Wednesday.
"Leave Syria alone, think about us instead"
People chanted "Leave Syria alone, think about us instead" in Toopkhone Square in Tehran.
The Iranian State has declared several times that it supports the Syrian regime, and recent news reports have said Iran transferred $10 billion dollars to Syria.
This is provocative news at a time when Iranian citizens are suffering the effects of a deep financial crisis spurred on by international sanctions against Iran.
The President of Panama, Ricardo Martinelli, yesterday tried to put a close to a chaotic week which left four people dead.
He gave a conciliatory speech inviting people to seek peace following serious confrontations in Colon in protest of Law 72.
The law would have allowed the sale of land located in the (tax) Free Zone of Colon.
The press conference was broadcast on Panama ’ s national channel on Sunday, October 28 to a public anxious to see what the Head of State would say after a silence previously broken by only two concise tweets.
These tweets were sent during his official visit to Japan which coincided with this crisis.
The Telemetro website summarised parts of the President's speech:

Is Khamis Gaddafi dead? Really really dead that is. The question is still making the rounds exactly a year after the fall of his father Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi.
Journalist Mary Fitzgerald tweets:
@ MaryFitzgeraldIT: Given Gaddafi's son Khamis reported captured / dead several times over past 20 months, not surprising many are waiting to see evidence # Libya
The LibyanYouthMovement remarks:
@ ShababLibya: We will wait for pictures and continue to update everyone on the story.
We all thought Khamis was dead! # Libya
And Huda notes:
@ hudduh: Khamis has died more times than Kenny.
Waiting for the inevitable mobile phone footage to confirm his capture / death. # Libya
NPR senior strategist Andy Carvin tweets:
@ acarvin: Show us Khamis Gaddafi.
Prove it.
Until you do, he'll remain Kayser Soze. # libya
Meanwhile, Iyad El-Baghdadi predicts:
@ iyad _ elbaghdadi: Some douchebag creates & circulates a photoshopped image of dead Khamis # Gaddafi in 3...
2... # Libya
And Libyan AletheiaLibya comments:
@ AletheiaLibya: If # Gaddafi "lives forever in the heart of Libyans", it's only fair that Moussa Ibrahim & Khamis should live forever in # Libya's prisons.
Moussa Ibrahim was Gaddafi's spokesman.
News reports today say he was captured in Tarhouna, south of the capital Tripoli.
Journalist Jenan Moussa calls for reason:
@ jenanmoussa: Guys guys stop spreading rumors.
I confirm that no one in # Libya can confirm news right now about Khamis Gaddafi
Only time will tell if Khamis Gaddafi will meet his father's fate anytime soon.

Syrian photographers from around the country are revealing, sharing, and archiving Syria's uprising through photographs which showcase destruction.
Despite the limited media sources, what comes out from Syria shows the horrific reality Syrians on the ground face as they see their country being literally torn apart.
Although there is no liable resources to confirm the locations of the photographs nor the number of victims, the next few pictures are just a sample to consider of how Syria's infrastructure and residential areas have been affected.
Among hundreds of photographers, Yazan Homsy ‏ shares with us scenes from the destruction of Homs.
He describes himself as:
@ YazanHomsY: Yazan Homsy, son of the great Homs, activist in the Syrian revolution, from Khalidya neighborhood.

Bolivian journalist Fernando Vidal and radio technician Karen Arce from Radio Popular in Yacuiba, a city on the Bolivian border with Argentina, were attacked by four masked men on Monday, October 29, 2012. The men threw petrol bombs inside the station and poured gasoline on Vidal and lit him on fire.
Arce was also injured in the attack.
Vidal, the radio station's manager and owner, and Arce are being treated for their burns as the investigation on the arson attack moves forward.
Early theories indicate that the attack may have been related to Vidal's outspoken criticism of corruption and contraband.
Vidal's son-in-law, journalist Esteban Farfán Romero, has been actively reporting on the journalists' health and on the developments of the case.
On Monday, October 29, Farfán reported on Facebook:
SERIOUS REPORT: Radio Popular of Yacuiba has suffered a terrorist attack.
4 people with masks entered the studio at the Radio and poured gasoline on the face of journalist Fernando Vidal.
Mr. Fernando Vidal is being treated at the hospital. His condition is stable.
He also shared pictures of the radio station after the attack on Twitter and Facebook:
Radio station after attack.

Shared by Esteban Farfán Romero on Facebook
We are working to rebuild the Radio Station.
At this moment we are getting rid of everything that was burned in order to go back on the air as Fernando Vidal told us before leaving for Santa Cruz.
This is the Radio after the attack.
On October 31, Farfan (@ EstebanFarfanR) tweeted the latest report on the detentions:
@ EstebanFarfanR: THE LATEST: The Police have detained the fourth person involved in the attack on Radio Popular.
Reporters Without Borders has "taken note of the progress apparently being made" in the investigation of the arson attack.
They also report that they spoke with Farfán, who told them that,
Vidal believes that two Tarija department government officials were behind the attack.
Interior minister Carlos Romero supports the theory.
The attack was clearly designed to halt Vidal ’ s programme, which he was dedicating that day to discussing local contraband cases.
Farfán confirmed that the family shares this theory on his Facebook account.
The article by Reporters Without Borders adds:
A former Yacuiba mayor and municipal councillor, Vidal has never hesitated to speak out about corruption in Tarija department and has always criticized the way public funds are managed at both national and regional level, where they have increased significantly now that the Chaco region is earning more than 100 million dollars a year from the sale of its natural gas.
The Bolivian government, the United Nations, and various press organizations have condemned the attack.
Furthermore, Farfán reports that citizens of Yacuiba marched to demand justice. He shares photos from the march on Twitter:

“I am always going online and I write down the name and surname of those insulting our president (Evo Morales), ” said Álvaro García Linera, Bolivia ’ s vice president, on October 20, 2012.
While members of the opposition considered this statement an attempt to restrict freedom of speech in the country, the Minister of Government, Carlos Romero, asserted that social media is “regularly misused to attack the Government or misinform about its work ”.
Netizens also reacted in different ways to the controversy.
Twitter user Juan Carlos Quiroga (@ jcrquiroga) looked at the positive side of the vice president ’ s statement:

@ jcrquiroga: I am pleased that the vice president talked about social networks, because for the first time we know they are interested in social media. @ joup1
Nevertheless, Mr. García Linera doesn't have an official page, profile or account on Facebook or Twitter, the two most popular social media platforms in Bolivia.
Others, like Mario Durán (@ mrduranch), a Twitter user based in El Alto, suggested that the government is taking the wrong approach:
@ mrduranch: The blue idea (referring to the ruling party, MAS) to monitor social networks allow "bad things"...
On that logic we should eliminate kitchen knives # fb Other netizens are asking the government to pay attention to important issues and the needs of the Bolivian people.
Fabiola Chambi (@ fabiolachambi) commented via her Twitter account:
@ fabiolachamb: The Vice president and his "trackers" should also write down the complaints and needs of Internet users.
There are other places where the people manifest themselves!
The vice president's statement and citizens' reactions - both online and offline - have brought back a debate about the control of social media in Bolivia.
On Gobernabilidad Democrática's Facebook page, a platform which aims to broaden the democratic exchange in the country, Miriam Romero Baldiviezo expressed her support to set restrictions, particularly to deal with issues like pornography and crime, and to legislate on the use and access of the Internet.
However, replying to Miriam Romero's comment, some activists consider such controls unfeasible due to a number of constraints; for instance, most people in Bolivia connect to the web via Internet cafes and other public spaces, where the same IP address is assigned to different users.
Puerto Rican street artist and photographer Enrique Arce, known as Aslan, (@ ASLANTWIT) has been posting photographs of airplanes on his Instagram account for over six months now as part of his "# parriba" (upwards) series.
The project looks to engage with the community via a "Scavenger Hunt" challenge detailed on his blog.
Selections from the series are printed and pasted unto tiles, which are then tacked on to walls and buildings throughout San Juan.
Those lucky enough to be the first to find one of these tiles and send a picture to Aslan with its location win a copy of the tile for them to keep.
In a recent interview published by Global Voices, Aslan notes: "I started collecting at first without a clear motive.
It wasn't until I decided to work on the series that I realized that this exploration could lend itself to a different type of artistic creation that would attract attention.
Its interesting to see how simple ideas such as looking up (or "p'arriba") and photographing an airplane are the ones that attract more people. "
Below you will find ten of my favorite # parriba airplane photographs from the gigantic series - with over 600 photographs to date!
All photos are republished with the artist's permission.
Follow Aslan as he continues to collect more photographs through Twitter and his blog.
The following paintings belong to Aslan's collection of Creaturas en limbo (Creatures In Limbo), presented here to show some of the artist's other work.

Arab netizens had some harsh words to share after waiting to the wee hours of the early morning to tune in to the last US Presidential Debate 2012 between President Obama and Republican hopeful Mitt Romney before the November elections.
On Twitter, netizens rammed the US policy on Syria, saying both Obama and Romney were two faces of the same coin.
Abu Hatem tweets:
Ahmed Shihab-Eldin adds:
@ ASE: He doesn't have different ideas, bc we are doing exactly what we are supposed to be doing. # Obama on Romney's plans in # Syria # Debate
Obama's position on Syria?
Shared by The New Syria page on Facebook
And The New Syria page on Facebook says:
Looks like # Obama and # Romney care more about # Syria becoming an 'ally' to the United States in the long run than actually trying to help the civilians there.
We don't need your help, Allah is on our side
THE 47th notes:
@ THE _ 47th: So Obama wants 2 c what Israel wants be done in Syria (w / o any intrvntion), Romney thnks Syria is an opportunity.
30k dead r an opportunity.
Meanwhile, Syrian Amal Hanano addresses Obama:
@ AmalHanano: Obama, you don't need to visit the Holocaust Museum to remember evil, turn on YouTube and watch # Syria bleed. Tunisian Sami Ben Romdhane tweets:
@ samiTunis: All what I can remember from tonight US presidential debate on CNN is that they are sponsored by Exxon Mobil..: -) # fact
And Syrian THE 47th jokes:
@ THE _ 47th: The winner today was clearly twitter.
On policymic, Tunisian blogger Ahmed Medien adds: Monday's debate was not a stellar for both candidates.
As someone who might be affected by these same very policies and corporations between U.S. and MENA, I was particularly unimpressed. It is the same talk that we have heard since years
'No Sports Violence in Guayaquil' is the name of a new campaign that hopes to eradicate violence in football and in the stadiums, after a confrontation on November 4 between fans of Barcelona and Emelec (both professional football teams and participants in the "Shipyard Derby"), left George Murillo León, age 20, dead.
Both national and international media covered the clash.
In its online edition, El Universo gave details of the incident: "A gunshot to the forehead, with an exit wound in the back of his head, purportedly by an Emelec fan, produced irreversible brain damage according to a source at the Luis Vernaza Hospital, where he was taken around 11: 30."
Fox Sports also wrote about it on their webpage, recalling that "this is the second death in recent years from football violence in Ecuador, the previous one being Carlos Cedeño, a 12 year old boy who died after being hit by a flare in 2007."
Representatives from the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Sports, Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF in Spanish), the National Assembly, and the Emelec and Barcelona sports clubs are working to counteract the acts of violence perpetrated by fans and supporters of football teams in the first division.
After having reached an agreement, the parties published the "Ten Commandments Against Violence in Football" on the Ministry of the Interior's webpage.

On social media, using the tag # NoMasViolencia, people across the country showed their concern about sports violence.
Football fans, like @ michael _ cse and @ Sandtolo, reject the aggression and violence:
@ michael _ cse: For love of the team, you didn't only kill a citizen, you KILLED A FAMILY and plunged the country into mourning
@ Sandtolo: I condemn violence in all forms, violence only comes from despotism and egocentrism In the same vein, Twitter user @ ANDRESL9 says:
Denounce violent people Rafael Correa, the President of Ecuador (@ MashiRafael), also commented about the incident on his Twitter account:
@ MashiRafael: Football and the death of Barcelona fan George Murillo.
Intense week to get consensus on the candidacy to announce at the convention

Officials and the public hope that the new ideas like "No sports violence in Guayaquil" will reach schools, outlying areas, and even hospitals and mobile clinics, since football is one of the few sports that moves the masses in the whole country, especially in cities like Quito and Guayaquil.

During November 5 and 6, 2012, over 100 young journalists, leaders, and experts in social media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) participated in the Third Global Voices Against Corruption Forum, organized by the Global Youth Anti-Corruption Network (GYAC) in Brasilia, Brazil.
Global Voices contributor Andrea Arzaba reports about the Latin American youth session for Animal Político:
Freedom of expression, lack of unity in the region and fear to talk about issues regarding government transparency were among the topics discussed at the Latin American youth session Participants in the meeting shared a common vision regarding the limited use of technology for the ethical development of the region and, above all, the lack of training for youth in anti-corruption issues. They also talked about education, where they discussed the importance of bringing about change by working with the youth, since they will soon be holding important positions, vulnerable to corruption.
Andrea also shares a video where she showcases some projects in favor of transparency and accountability led by Latin American youth.
With Piero Locatelli, Andrea interviewed Margarita Valdés from Xpressate (El Salvador), Caio Monteiro from Marília Transparente (Brazil), and Andrea Benavides from Ocasa (Colombia):

Here are the 10 best parodies of Gangnam Style picked from a slew of meme videos.
First off - Gangnam Style in politics:
1.
Ai Weiwei ’ s Gangnam Protest
One of the latest Gangnam dancers is the famous Chinese artist / activist Ai Weiwei.
Ai Weiwei made headlines by appearing in this video in a hot pink shirt and rocking a silly but passionate 'horse-riding' style dance.
But he did not forget to deliver his message on censorship by wearing handcuffs and switching the title of the video into “Grass Mud Horse" (see here for an explanation).
2.
U.S. Election, Mitt Romney-Style
With the United States Presidential election right around the corner, this video was featured by College Humor.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's impersonator raps and dances in the video, mocking Romney ’ s reputation as a out-of-touch rich guy living a posh lifestyle.
3.
Bolivian-Style
Gangnam Style has even landed in the Bolivian political landscape.
A Bolivian YouTube user, KwonBanYa, uploaded a video featuring representations of President Evo Morales and Vice President Alvaro García Linera, with a selection of other members of the ruling party and the opposition appearing in cameos.
+ U.N. Style
Not technically a meme video, but worth showing, this depicts United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who is a South Korean national, dancing Gangnam Style with Psy at the UN headquarters in New York.
Now for a look at some of the weirdest parodies:
4.
Inmate-Style
The Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is known for using choreographed dance routines to rehabilitate its inmates.
Watch this amazing scene of numerous inmates in orange jumpsuits galloping in unison.
5.
Lifeguard-Style
Having fun and goofing around seems harmless, but not in certain locations, especially your workplace.
After a group of lifeguards in El Monte, California, posted this Gangnam Style parody, appearing in uniform at the city pool, 14 people were fired.
Psy, the K-Pop sensation himself, pleaded for them to get their jobs back. The city recently voted to rehire those lifeguards.
Psy meanwhile often makes comments on users' remakes of his hit song:
6.
Marching Band's Gangnam Style
He said in an interview he found one marching band's tribute "touching", referring to this vide by Ohio University's marching band.
And finally, the most unlikely tributes...
7.
Noam Chomsky Style
An M.I.T. Gangnam Style parody video has gone viral by featuring one of the world's renowned linguist and activist Noam Chomsky.
8.
Sports Star's Flash Mob
Among several sports stars who have galloped along to Psy's song, is a flash mob led by NBA player Roy Hibbert.
9.
Brunei Style
Brunei would be one of the last places South Koreans might expect to hear Gangnam Style from.
But here it is, a hilarious meme video playing from the opposite side of the world.
10.
Navy Gangnam Style
A group of U.S. Naval Academy sailors sang along to Psy ’ s hit and galloped around in white uniforms.
Unlike the lifeguards who came under fire, these Navy midshipmen reportedly have earned approval from the Navy.
Have we missed out your favourite Gangnam Style parody?

Rural communities in Guatemala were severely affected by the strong 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's Pacific coast on November 7, 2012.
The blog for the community library Mi Nuevo Mundo (My new world) -part of the Rising Voices grantee project Xela Civic Libraries, located in the Huitán village in the Quetzaltenango department- has been sharing photos and reports of the earthquake's impact on the families living in this rural area of Guatemala.
In a post published on November 10, community librarian Roman Díaz Castañón reported that several houses collapsed and families were left homeless in an area called Huitancito in Huitán:
the families cry because of this disaster, they are in extreme poverty and are going through an alarming situation.
Help, such as food, has not arrived from institutions, we need your help.

Two days later, Roman reported that on Sunday, November 11, Riecken Foundation Guatemala and the community library had provided aid to ten families affected by the earthquake in Huitancito, Huitán.
The post highlighted that the village still needed help with food, kitchen utensils, blankets, and building houses.
Furthermore, Roman added that 100 families were affected by the earthquake, and 20 lost their houses.

Later that day, a short post announced that help from the government had arrived on November 12.
The blog will keep readers informed about the distribution of food and other aid.

Guatemala has been hit by several aftershocks since November 7, including a 6.5-mangitude earthquake on November 12.
The official death toll for the whole country is currently at 42 casualties.
When the deadline passed a lot of protests were initiated by bloggers and journalists. But there was no headway in the investigation.

More than eight months have passed since the murder but there has not been any acceptable progress in the investigation. Under pressure, the incumbent home minister declared on 25 September, 2012 that the investigation will be completed and the mystery would be revealed by October 10, 2012.
According to his promise just one day before the deadline he announced the arrest of seven suspects.
The suspects have criminal records and have been arrested previously on charges like murder.
He was initially detained for questioning by the police.
But the family members of victims claim that three persons have taken him somewhere.
Many journalists have not accepted the statements of the Home Minister. They claimed that the statement is unclear and confusing.
According to them this does not reveal the mystery and the real motive of the killers.
After the murder Runi's younger brother Nowsher Roman filed a case in the Sher-e-Bangla police station.
He wrote in Facebook last october 10:
The Facebook Status Of Nowsher Roman
Me, my family is very unfortunate... feeling pity for myself.
And Megh (the surviving son of the couple), my family, and those people who are being framed - my heart aches for them, their helpless parents, spouses...
Is there no God????
Is there no God???? (Quoted with permission)
Nowsher Roman was present in the bloggers protest in front of the home ministry on 15 May, 2012
The mother of the slain journalist Sagar Sarwar thinks that the arrests are a setup and she said "We just want to know the truth, want to see the real murderer behind bars."
On 28 April 2012 bloggers arranged a road painting protest against the killings of the couple.
Source: BDNews20.com blog
Another theory is the murderers were connented with the ruling parties.
If there is no acceptable investigation done these theories will seem more legitimate. "
After the murder, the police said that it is the work of amateurs.
However, the current Home Minister said that among the arrested five are contract killers.
Arafatul Islam, a diaspora journalist mentions in Facebook about this:
If contract killers were engaged then why family friend Tanvir was arrested?
Who paid the killers?
What was the motive of the murder?
How the eight suspects are related to this case and how they were identified, I want to know answers to these questions. (published with permission)
Journalist Shawkat Mahmud wrote on September 26, 2012 in Facebook:
Since 1971 29 journalists have been killed (in this country).
Out of this 17 people have died during this tenure of the government. many journalists were injured on duty.
They are threatened regularly.
The IGP said that there is a significant progress in the investigation.
But the detective branch officers said that the evidences have been destroyed.
And we are continuing our protests.
Sadat Metro in Cairo, by Peter Morgan (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) The metro is back in Egypt - after a four hour strike.
Train services, which ferry up to 2 million people across Cairo daily, came to a standstill as drivers stopped work in protest against the chairperson of the metro board of directors, who is being accused of corruption.
The workers are also demanding better salaries and working conditions.
On Twitter, netizens cheered on the strike, lending their support to what they described as the workers' legitimate demands.
Salma El Tarzi salutes the metro workers on the success of their strike.
She writes:
@ Salma _ El _ Tarzi: Congratulations to the Metro strikers!
The people effected by the strike should have a problem with the government and not with the workers who went on strike to demand their rights
@ Monasosh: Those effected by the metro strike should go find a way for their demands to be met so that they can return to their work. It's shameful for people to expect others to get exasperated in silence while they continue to serve you.
And Ola Shahba calls for more support for the metro workers:
@ OlaShahba: The metro strike is an example of workers who know how to hurt the government and force it to negotiate as they realise that the service they provide cannot be stopped for too long.
We should support them so that their don't cave in to pressure
Dina Samak compares the success of the metro worker's strike with the lack of attention the on-going doctors' strike is facing in Egypt.
She tweets:
But the doctors' strike continues because the Ruler still doesn't care for the poor.
The solution is in solidarity between everyone.
Egyptian doctors have have been on partial strike since October 1.
And Nermeen Bedair adds:
@ Nermbed: My doctor friends on Facebook (those with and those against the strike) suggest that doctors request the metro workers to add the doctors' demands to theirs
While Mohammed Shawkuy remarks:
@ shawkination: The metro drivers held a strike which brought the country to a standstill.
After four hours, the ministry changes.
Doctors have been on strike for 45 days and no one is paying attention because no one has died
Bolivia ’ s National Census of Population and Housing 2012 will be held on November 21.
The previous national census took place more than a decade ago, in December 2001.
Led by the National Institute of Statistics (INE in Spanish), the national 2012 census aims to provide “updated information on demographic, social, economic and housing conditions in the country, allowing to adjust, define and evaluate plans, programmes, public policies and strategies for sustainable human, economic and social development at the national, departmental and municipal levels ”.
Targeting primarily demographic and housing issues, the census questionnaire has sparked a debate on social media platforms regarding question 17: “Does this household have Internet service? ”
Researchers, analysts, and activists expected more inquiry and information coming out of the 2012 census. Nevertheless, the sole question regarding Internet access inquires only about the service, disregarding type of connection, quality, uses, digital divide, and so on, missing an opportunity to collect in-depth information on this matter.
Nayeli and Carla by Safe the Children (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)
It is estimated that about 30% of the population and 9% of households have Internet access in Bolivia.
The number is not high; however, the quality shows even a worse scenario: only 0.7 of every 100 have broadband connections.
Mario Durán, a blogger and activist based in El Alto, argues on his blog that question 17 should be answered “no ” if the access to the Internet is via mobile broadband stick or mobile phone.
After sharing his position on social media platforms, a number of replies came in favor and against his argument.
Eliana Quiroz, a well-known digital activist, commented on an open discussion at the campaigning Facebook page “Más ancho de banda para Bolivia ” (More Broadband for Bolivia):
Adding more questions is expensive and (the government) does not consider the Internet to be strategic, so it did not include anything else.
The question is as it is and so we just need to answer it.
For the next census I hope there is a set of questions about the Internet. Lobbying and advocacy must be done at the right time.
In spite of the gaps in the census questions, Grover Yapura (@ GroverYapura) states via his Twitter account:
@ GroverYapura: # Censo2012 There is only one option on the 21st: Being counted and help to count # Bolivia
Mainstream and citizen media are actively reporting on Bolivia ’ s National Census via the hashtags # Censo2012 and # CensoBo.

Help! ".
Netizens are invited to share a photo with the campaign's message on Facebook, or tweet with the hashtag # SiIquitosTuvieraInternetVeloz ("If Iquitos had fast Internet").
The campaign -which was started by Alan Lozano, an economist from Iquitos- tries to raise awareness about the need to improve the precarious Internet connection available in Iquitos.

On 7 November 2012, up to 2,000 people attacked three Dalit settlements in the Dharmapuri District of Tamil Nadu in India, according to the International Dalit Solidarity Network (ISDN) with sources from The Hindu, IBN, Times of India and Countercurrents. According to newspaper reports, a nursing student, from the Vanniyar (Shudra) community married a man from Aadidravida (dalit) community in the Natham Colony.
As Vidya Bhushan Rawat (@ freetohumanity), a social and human rights activist, writes in Countercurrents in a post titled Caste And Honor: The violence against Dalits in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu is a shocking reminder of social prejudices prevalent in our society and how honor is closely linked to our caste identity. According to Rawat, “The newspapers have not reported the entire incident and completely ignore as who are the people who have attacked.
While this kind of violence is not permitted in the constitution, “violence against Dalits cannot evaporate with simple rule of law. ”
Guriya & Desi Lal are Dalits or untouchables, part of the Harigans, the people in charge of cleaning the streets.

Newspapers have also suggested that there have been nearly ten inter-caste marriages between Vanniyars and Dalits in this village, suggesting that the violence was incited for political purposes to prevent the threat of growing incidents of such cases in a systematic and 'well-organized' attack.

Nasrin Sotoudeh, source: http: / / ahurai.com / social
The Iranian blogosphere is filled with joy as lawyer and prisoner of conscience Nasrin Sotoudeh has reportedly ended her hunger strike after 49 days.
Multiple sources, including Kaleme website who are affiliated with the opposition Green Movement, have quoted Nasrin Sotoudeh's husband, Reza Khandan, saying that meetings with MPs and negotiations with the Iranian Parliament Speaker and Head of the Judiciary have resulted in lifting the travel ban imposed on their teenage daughter.
With her demand fulfilled, Nasrin Sotoudeh ended her hunger strike.
A very proud and happy Iranian blogger, Azadi Esteghlal Edalat (meaning Freedom, Independence and Justice) writes:
Standing up against cruelty and injustice till death, and making the whole world join in her battle against the injustice that was done to her loving daughter by the regime, our dear Nasrin Sotoudeh ended her hunger strike now that legal restrictions against Mehraveh have been lifted.
She taught the suffering Iranian people a lesson of hope and resistance.
Nasrin Sotoudeh, the lioness of Iran, the pride of every single liberal Iranian.
Happy Victory!
Artwork from Nasrin Sotoudeh support group on Facebook.
The words read: "Your mere presence is the shattering of darkness."
Azadeghi praised Nasrin Sotoudeh's courage and says:
It was the victory of an Iranian woman's will against the Taliban's regime.
Nasrin Sotoudeh should know she was not alone and many Iranians supported her.
Nasrin Sotoudeh talks about juvenile execution
In this short interview (English subtitles) Nasrin criticizes the Islamic Republic's judiciary system, and calls for the regime to stop executing prisoners under the age of 18.
On Monday, December 17, 2012 the third edition of Barcamp Cali, a Free Culture event organised in the city of Cali, Colombia, by DELM Cali and the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente will take place, with the participation of communities such as Fosschix Colombia, Fundación Casa del Bosque, PrimeCom and Trueque Digital.
Here is an extract from the invitation made via the event's blog:
You may be wondering what a 'Barcamp' is; it's very simple, it's a place where knowledge can be shared freely, openly and in a participatory way, on topics related with ICTs across voluntary presentations called 'unconferences'... there are people willing to share what they know and also willing to listen to what others know.
The event has created a buzz among netizens in Cali, who have been tweeting about it, like Luis RoDevia (@ luisrodevia):
@ luisrodevia: I love these initiatives # barcampcali3 @ barcampcalico http: / / barcampcali.co / blog / # Cali
Barcamp Cali, 2nd Edition (CC BY-SA 3.0) Nelson Adrián Franco (@ NelsonAdrianF), one of the organisers, pointed out:
@ NelsonAdrianF: Those who like sharing software, art and cultural content can't miss # Barcampcali3 cc @ barcampcalico
While Lina María (@ LinaMaO) commented:
@ LinaMaO: Hey, how cool is it that Prof Julio will go to @ barcampcalico http: / / barcampcali.co / 2012 / el-profe-julio-presente-en-el-3er-barcamp-cali / … hehe you can't imagine the calculus classes that I have seen xD
She is referring to the teacher and engineer from Cali, Julio Alberto Ríos Gallego, better known as ‘ Profe Julio ’ on YouTube, where he is very popular (almost a kind of star); and what is unusual is that he has done it in fields like physics and maths, ones that are so unattractive at first sight for users of that platform.
The Barcamp's blog explains:
Barcamp Cali, 2nd Edition (CC BY-SA 3.0)
As was previously mentioned, the free software female community Fosschix Colombia will actively participate in the event, and one of its members, Liz García, will give an 'unconference' about the empowerment of free software and gender.
The Barcamp's blog writes the following about Fosschix:
This community has been working for three years to motivate women so that they participate and get started in the world of free software, whether it be in development, investigation or dissemination, and that they become actively engaged with Free Culture.
Not long ago they successfully organised the first National Congress of Women, Technology and Free Culture in Bogotá.
It is worth pointing out that about 100 people attended the first edition of Barcamp Cali, while some 300 attended the second.
The attendance this year is expected to be the same or greater.

Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest freestanding mountain in the world at 5,895 meters.
The current shrinking and thinning of Kilimanjaro's ice field is similar to other glacier retreat in mid-to-low latitudes across the globe.
At the current rate, Kilimanjaro is expected to become ice-free some time between 2022 and 2033.

Bloggers' suggestions
A number of natural wonders were omitted from the shortlist, so a few bloggers have added their own suggestions via their blogs.
A slight controversy was the fact that a few countries were featured several times while others were not mentioned at all, despite having worthy candidates.
The Victoria Falls, Zambia and Zimbabwe
The Victoria Falls at the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe is already selected as one of the seven natural wonders of the world.

Global Voices
Have you ever wondered how we at Global Voices do what we do?
Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the 700-plus members of our diverse, global and entirely virtual community pull together stories.
Every day our section leaders, editors and volunteer authors and translators work together across borders, time zones and language barriers to amplify the best of citizen and social media, report on online freedom of expression and support others in joining the global conversation.
To kick off this year's holiday fundraising campaign, this breakdown of how one article came into being shows how the coordinated efforts of many people combine to make GV so unique.
October 23, 2012: João Miguel, from his home in Fortaleza, Brazil, e-mails his fellow volunteers on the Portuguese language team mailing list about an incident involving the Guaraní Kaiowá, the second largest indigenous ethnic group in Brazil, who are under threat of eviction from their ancestral lands in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Janet, in the UK, quickly writes up a short post in English, while six other members of the group in five different cities in Brazil, Portugal and Spain get to work researching the story.
October 24, 2012: Sara, Global Voices' Portuguese language editor, publishes the story in Portuguese in collaboration with Diego, Elisa, João Miguel, Luís and Raphael.
October 25, 2012: Janet begins translating the piece into English, leaning on our Multilingual Editor Paula in London and João Miguel in Fortaleza for help with subtitling the embedded video.
The English version is sent to the sub-editor mailing list, where it's picked up by Kevin in Melbourne, Australia.
Kevin proofreads the post, and it's published on the Global Voices in English site.
In just a few hours, nine people on three continents, five countries and seven cities have collaborated to spread the story of "The Cry of Resistance of the Guarani Kaiowa" to the world in Portuguese and English.
October 26, 2012: Ines translates the post into French.
October 31, 2012: Cristina, Mario and Gabriela translate the post into Catalán, German and Spanish, respectively.
November 2, 2012: Giulia translates the post into Italian.
Right now, other Global Voices teams are doing exactly the same, across borders and time zones and languages, to amplify important citizen-driven stories the mainstream media doesn't have the time or interest to cover.
We're thankful for the funding we receive from the foundations who've supported us over the years, but in order to keep doing what we do, and to stay independent, free and sustainable, we also depend on the generous support of independent friends and readers like you.
Your donations help cover the cost of server space, administrative costs, our microgrant programs and Global Voices staff. This holiday season, please consider a gift to Global Voices.

Whenever members of the Global Voices community travel to another country, they usually find a way to meet one or more fellow 'GVers'.
A few days ago, contributor Janet Gunter was in Lima, Peru, and I arranged to meet over some typical Pisco Sours, and talk about her involvement with GV.
Here are some questions and answers based on our conversation; alternatively watch Janet's interview on video (English subtitles available):
Juan Arellano (JA): How did you get involved with GV?
Janet Gunter (JG): Through Sarita, and our blogs about East Timor.
We actually met in person for the first time in East Timor.
Then I met Paula here in London.
GV has always been for me about meeting and working with good people.
On the GV Portuguese email list, I feel like I have dozens of friends around the world with similar interests and values. That's something really rare for me. Janet Gunter, photo by pattamanuch.com used with authorization.
JA: So you started collaborating with GV Portuguese as a translator, an author, or both?
JG: As an author - covering Portuguese speaking Africa. Then when people started writing in Portuguese, I started translating their work into English.
I mostly translate our African authors.
JA: Tell us about your role in GV's special coverage "Europe in Crisis".
JG: I'm the instigator / cheerleader!
I lived in Portugal for three years and I feel things that are happening there have a personal importance to me.
Sara and I thought that there needed to be more coverage of citizen voices with the deepening crisis in Europe in 2011. And so we just started a Special Coverage page, and there has been a tremendous response from authors, translators and from our audience.
Plus Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French GV sites all have very "engagé" editors.
It's been a real pleasure linking and getting to know everybody across Europe.
JA: Is there something new you think could be done to improve GV's coverage of Europe (in crisis)?
JG: We need an RSS feed, and ideally we need an editor but we are looking for institutional sponsorship for this. As a freelancer you work with NGOs whilst at the same time keeping another foot in other areas. How do you reconcile these sometimes very different worlds?
JG: With 30 columns on my Tweetdeck and having no "personal life"!
(This really came out when I "mapped" my interests.)
JA: Two questions then: What really motivates you? And, what challenges have you faced in your different jobs?
I want to work with dynamic, good people. Beyond people, a combination of reacting to injustice, creativity, and wanting to be out in the world.
Challenges are dealing with burnout, systems that are not responsive or made for real people, convincing management and institutions to take risks. JA: You say you're a bad tourist but at the same time you have travelled a lot.
Tell us something about this.
JG: The only reason to accumulate money or wealth is to then spend it on experience!
I don't own a house, don't have a car, don't own much at all.
But I also enjoy slow train journeys and visiting my many friends in far flung places.
JA: Can you share some of those great travelling experiences with us?
JG: Too many - that would be a book in and of itself! Last winter I took the train from Los Angeles to New Orleans, departing from my California family, stopping in the west Texas plain for a couple of days and ending up with friends in New Orleans.
It was slow, magical, meditative. I love empty spaces, so west Texas was a perfect interlude.
Then I went to see my 94 year-old grandfather who was born in New Orleans, and drove two days back to my hometown of St Louis, with my dad, dodging tornado warnings and listening to country music on AM radio, arriving in time for my mother's warm soup for dinner.
This is the kind of trip I love.
Apart from all the things she is currently doing, Janet finds time to work on a personal project: the restart project.
She talks about this project in the following video:

It's Christmas in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, Palestine, the birth place of Jesus Christ.
What better way than to celebrate this occasion than by sharing photographs and reactions of netizens to this event, celebrated by billions worldwide.

Gazans stayed up all night as Israel continued to pound the Palestinian enclave.
The situation flared up when Israel and Gaza exchanged fire - which still continues now - after Israel killed Hamas military leader Ahmed Al-Jabari during an air raid on Gaza yesterday.
According to Press reports, the current bout of fighting has left up to 13 Gazans and three Israelis dead.
On Twitter, Ebaa Rezeq breaks down the toll on the Palestinian side:
@ Gazanism: The toll until now: 15 martyrs (among them three children, a woman pregnant with twins and two elderly people), plus 140 injured # Gaza

We teach life, world!
And Majed Abusalama adds:
@ MajedAbusalama: Our morales are high in Gaza.
Let them destroy everything and kill our children but they will never be able to kill our will and our dreams.
To liberation by the will of God!

Voices of Dignity, a multimedia project by the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), tells the story of Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza, two Colombian women who fled their homes after paramilitaries killed their husbands and raided their villages.
The project, released in late November 2012, includes three photogalleries and a 22-minute video which can be watched in full online.
Marta Martinez, producer of Voices of Dignity, wrote a guest post for Witness as part of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence campaign, where she explains:
Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza survived an attack of right-wing paramilitaries on their villages, in which women and girls were raped, homes burned and a number of people killed, including their husbands.

Marta also highlights the intended message of Voices of Dignity:
As the government of Colombia enters new rounds of peace talks with leftist guerrillas Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), there has been much speculation on the prospects for sustainable peace.
ICTJ ’ s research and comparative experience clearly show that sustainable peace cannot be reached without ensuring justice, accountability, and victims ’ rights.
In the words of Maria Camila Moreno, head of ICTJ ’ s Colombia Office, “Victims are not numbers.
They are people with flesh and blood, with great dignity, who have a clear view of the steps that Colombia must take to respond to their right to compensation. ”
Petronila Mendoza.

Through the powerful testimonies of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity provides an intimate look into the lives of the victims of Colombia's armed conflict.
An article by ICTJ on Voices of Dignity adds:
In telling the story of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity breaks the stereotype of women victims of conflict as passive actors in a transitioning society.
Instead, it shows them as active participants and leaders; for their families and communities, they are not victims, but heroes.
Marta states that the goal of this multimedia project is to "reaffirm the fundamental rights of victims in Colombia and elsewhere: the rights to truth, acknowledgment, and redress."
Voices of Dignity is available in Spanish and will soon be available in Arabic.
Saudi human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady has been getting much attention in the Saudi Twittersphere the last few weeks.
Al-Bajady is one of the co-founders of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and he has been detained since March 21, 2011, after taking part in a protest calling for an end to arbitrary detainment in front of the Interior Ministry building in Riyadh.
He was secretly tried and sentenced last April to four years in prison.
On November 14, ACPRA issued the following statement:
In the last phone call from human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady, which was on 19 September 2012, he told his wife that he would start a hunger strike right after the phone call to protest maltreatment.
Our sources told us that he was then taken into solitary confinement.
Since he announced hunger strike, no phone call was received.
Yesterday, December 9, @ freealbjadi announced a public hunger strike to support al-Bajady on December 10, which marks the international Human Rights Day:
@ freealbjadi: Experience what al-Bajady is facing in prison and announce your hunger strike tomorrow...
"Save al-Bajady" campaign logo
Tens of reformist figures announced that they will be taking part in the public hunger strike in the hashtag # سأشارك _ غدا _ بالإضراب _ عن _ الطعام _ تضامنا _ مع _ إضراب _ البجادي (I will be participating in the hunger strike in support for al-Bajady), including activist Mohammad al-Qahtani, ex-political prisoner Matrook al-Faleh, and famous blogger Fouad al-Farhan along with over 200 other people, while the previous public hunger strike in support for al-Bajady, which took place last March, had only 38 participants.
This led activists to announce success.
By strictly prohibiting demonstrations, Saudi Arabia invites new methods for public dissent, mostly undertaken by young people.
It seems like the revolutionary spirit is galvanized in Egypt, thanks to President Mohammed Morsy's power grab - his recent decision that gave him broad decision-making power.
The decision sparked nation-wide protests, most notably a sit-in was staged around the presidential palace.
Photographer Jonathan Rashad, who has been actively using his camera to document major events since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, shared the following photographs of graffiti which tell the story on his Flickr account.
Here is a selection:

The sit-in in front of the palace was attacked on December 5th, which resulted 6 deaths and much more left injured.
Testimonies of anti-Morsi protesters being tortured at the hands of Morsi supporters began surfacing later. Various walls were erected around the palace to prevent protesters from approaching.
These walls were targets of graffiti artists as well.

Maryanne Gabbani, a Canadian expat and blogger, wrote a new blog post entitled "Don't Mess With Egyptian Women" to mention two stories she heard recently which, took place in the village she's living in.
She starts her story by noting her observation on women in her village:
The women of my area have my deep and abiding respect.
They care for farms, families and homes in pretty tough conditions but never fail to have a smile, a greeting and to lend a hand to others.
They are the steel of their families.
While this is a very traditional part of the country and one of strong religious conviction, these women are also very accepting and friendly and have always been a source of laughter and joy for me, a very nontraditional aging Canadian.
She then noted the first story she heard from many of her neighbours, who are in disagreement with Muslim Brotherhood rule, as follows:
One neighbour told me how when buses came to shuttle protesters into Heliopolis for the demonstration at the presidential palace that turned so bloody a couple of weeks ago, quite a few of the mothers around me informed their sons that if anyone wanted to take the bus into town, they were welcome to do so but not to bother to come back.
The next story is about a new small religious group, of eight people, who decided to help locals to behave in a more "proper" manner. Maryanne says:
So apparently a group of Takfir wal Higra (Excommunication and Exodus) moved into our area to help our local population behave in a more "proper" manner.
They were seen walking along the roads in their short galabeyas (traditional dress) and had taken a mosque for preaching and an office in Abu Sir for organising.
A week or so ago, eight of the men went into the main souq of Abu Sir and as they were entering noticed one woman sitting by her produce with a little bit of leg showing from her galabeya.
Very rudely kicking at her leg, they told her to cover up and be decent.
This was a monumental mistake.
As it happened, this woman was the head woman for the souq and a member of a very populous clan in the area that number in the thousands.
She and the other women in the market attacked the eight men and beat them so severely that they had to go to the hospital.
When the men tried to file a report with the police about the attack, the police refused to take the report, saying that they weren't going against these women as well... were the men crazy?
So now the youth of Abu Sir are using the office as a tea room and the mosque is no longer being used for their fundamentalist sermons and no one has seen the Takfir group for some time.
She concludes her post by confirming:
If anyone is wondering who to support to get rid of Islamists in Egypt, here is your answer.
The women of Egypt are some of the strongest women I've ever seen.
Michael Hanna, an Egyptian blogger and pharmacist, continued his series of mourning the murder of trees, as well as demolishing antique villas in Heliopolis suburb in Cairo, and wrote an ode to a palm tree.
Three months ago, he took a photograph of what is perhaps the oldest palm tree in the region.
He blogs: Perhaps this Palm tree was the longest and oldest in Heliopolis area, and perhaps as old as the suburb itself.

Hanna continues: The above image was captured about three months ago.
Yesterday I passed by the place, and was surprised that someone decided to end it's life.. leaving only this.

Bolivian cyber activists worked collectively to unfold a potential unlawful patent over the use of Quick Response Codes, known as QR codes, in the country.
Earlier this month, Bolivian netizen @ hermany sparked curiosity when he enquired on Twitter about the alleged patented use of QR codes in Bolivia:
@ hermany: Can anyone in La Paz tell me if Advice Marketing Ltda. patented QR codes and one must pay this company for using them? # Boliva # Tech # fraude?
Photo by Lydia Shiningbrightly (CC BY 2.0)
The company ’ s website has withdrawn the patent announcement from its website, but activist Daniel Cotillas (@ danicotillas) captured and shared a screenshot.
Following up with the collective enquiring under the hashtag # QRBolivia, blogger Mario Durán from El Alto got in touch with the Intellectual Property National Service (SENAPI in Spanish) and representatives of the company.
Mario has been posting regular updates on the case in his blog under the question, "Can the use of QR codes in Bolivia be patented?"
According to the information gathered by Mario, Advice Marketing officially states that QR codes can be publicly used just by notifying them in advance.
Meanwhile, officials from SENAPI confirmed that the company applied for the patent back in September 2012; however, SENAPI has not issued a resolution on the matter (the legal term to reach a decision is 18 months).
Therefore, such patent or restriction may not be applicable.
Bolivian cyber activists will surely keep a close watch on the issue as the case develops in the coming months.
You can follow their discussion under the hashtag # QRBolivia.
A lot has been said about the liberating role technology has played in the Middle East uprising, yet there is more to be said about the mutual role the uprising is yet to play in liberating technology in the region.
This Wednesday, the official Facebook of the Egyptian prime minister published a summary of one of his recent meetings.
In it, the government agreed to spending $43.8 million to acquire licenses and software products from Microsoft.
Many Egyptian citizens started to express their anger after reading the news.
@ Aya _ Ayman: Yes, because the government fed and sheltered all the poor and homeless in Egypt and have a few extra millions left!
Nevertheless, the people were not angry because of the huge amount of money being spent, but were mainly angry because they see better alternatives that may cost less and also help develop the local software development community.
Samar Ali (@ SaMoRaAli) shared this banner on Twitter.
@ Gue3bara: Instead of spending this money, the government could have spent just one million on local software developers to develop alternative solutions for the government using open source software.
Omar Ak explained the meaning of Open Source Software briefly:
‏ @ i3mmoor: Pt - the open source besides being free, it can be modified and does not demand renewal. # OpenEgypt.
Nagla Rizk, who is founding director of the Access to Knowledge for Development Center (A2K4D) and member of the steering committee of the Open Africa Innovation Research Project (Open A.I.R), added on Twitter:
@ naglarzk: This contract with Microsoft, not only increases its presence in the Egyptian market, but also reduces the chances for small local companies to compete in the market, especially those relying on Open Source Software.
@ naglarzk: $43m deal w microsoft is real setback for # Egypt, esp after revolution with promise of openness, collaboration & freedom. # OpenEgypt
Hossam El-Hamalawy (@ 3arabawy) published more detailed reasons why this deal should not be sealed.
And many other organizations as well as individuals started to sign this petition.
Things did not stop here, but members of the Open Source community in Egypt called for a silent demonstration in front of the cabinet of ministers on the 30th of December.
Other demonstrations are also being arranged in different parts of Egypt. And the hashtag # OpenEgypt is now being used to introduce people to Open Source Software, and their benefits.
Once again an indigenous girl was killed after being brutally raped in Borodalupara village, Kawkhali Upazila of Rangamati district.
The victim, Khomaching Marma (14) was a student of class eight.
Her dead body was found in the slopes of a mountain just 200-300 yards away from her home.
She was last seen going to a nearby jungle to bring her family ’ s cattle back home.
Rina Dewan posted on her Facebook wall regarding the reason behind this heinous crime:
There is a settler village named Nallyachari Uttor Matha within half a kilometer of the place where Thomaching ’ s dead body was recovered. During the early 1980s the government evicted the indigenous Marmas from their land and settled Bengalis there.
Now those settlers claim a large portion of Borodalupara as theirs.
A few days ago, some Marma villagers planted ginger in their lands but the settlers destroyed their crops and created unrest. It has been learnt that conflict exists for land between the maternal uncle of Thomaching Marma and the Bengali settlers.
So, it is suspected that she was raped and killed to avenge.

Violence against indigenous women has increased in recent times. A few months ago, another indigenous girl was raped and killed.
She was a student of class five.
Hari kishore Chakma, a journalist, provides some statistics on the rape of indigenous women in an article at daily Prothom Alo:
Up to November of this year, 20 indigenous girls and women were raped in three hill districts.
In 2011, 10 indigenous women were raped.
Kapaeng, a human rights organization, reported this statistics.
According to this organization, 51 indigenous women were the victims of violence during this year. This number was 31 in 2011 and just 4 in 2008. This brutal rape and murder once again has spread anger and rage across the country.
Processions have been arranged in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet.
Netizen have also expressed their rage and protested.

Just like the numb, cold body of our sister, have we also become numb?

In the news, I saw India roaring in protest against the gang-rape in a Delhi bus. It felt good to see their unity.
Media is also standing with them. The India government has been forced to arrest the perpetrators.
Recently an indigenous girl was raped and killed at Borodalupara village in Kawkhali upazila of Rangamati district.
These offenses are establishing an image of Bangladesh in my mind.
The image of a rapist and a murderer.
It feels like ferocious potential rapists and murderers are roaming around us all the time.
There is no guarantee that some of them will not suddenly lose control and submit to their urges.
Iran is not known for its freedom of expression or popular demonstrations in the public. But urban art is alive there.
Frescoes, mosaics and other 'approved' art adorn the walls in certain cities, underground art, although not as apparent as in Europe, is still visible in Tehran: graffiti, tags and stencils are discretely or more openly present in cities.
Some walls are completely covered with propaganda paintings — of a martyr, for example. But this can also be an abstract image, simply ornamental.
Some are true works of art.
A few weeks ago, a Tehran photographer sent these photos of graffiti via email; he enclosed this remark:
I took these in Tehran, near a bus stop.
I think someone is fighting with the municipality of Tehran. One day he or she draws a graffiti, the other day the municipality removes it.
This goes on and on.

Now they painted something like a drawing or pattern on that wall to prevent that person from adding more graffiti. But before that this wall was really dirty.
But now at least it's not dirty.
So the enemy of the municipality is now a friend of people because that wall is not dirty anymore.
Those who express themselves in Iran are more at risk than those in Europe.
Currently, no law exists in Iran, but if authorities consider the work to be subversive; in that case, the art might become a crime. Street art is only springing up in Iran.
Let's hope it prospers.
The Three Kings came and went, but not before passing through New York City to celebrate with hundreds of children that came out for the parade organized by the Museo del Barrio on January 4, an atypically sunny Friday for the month. This Christmas celebration, whose historic and religious background is quite complex (much like Christianity itself), has been a part of the Caribbean and Latin American cultural traditions for numerous centuries. In Puerto Rico, for example, on the eve of the Three Kings' visit, children leave grass in a shoebox for the horses of Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltasar, thanking them for the gifts they will receive the next day.
In fact, this tradition has transformed over the years in a very creative way.
As such, the kings arrive on horseback, not on camels, and are celebrated with promises carved by santeros (artisans of religious images) that are a source of inspiration and joy. Without a doubt, the Puerto Rican and Latin American communities that are alive and vibrant in the metropolis that is New York have not stopped celebrating this day with much excitement, especially the children. So much so that the streets of East Harlem were paralyzed to see the passing of the carriages, the magi on stilts, Peruvian dances, capoeira, giant puppets and even two camels that live in a sanctuary in New Jersey.
Here we share a series of photographs taken by Puerto Rican artist Josué Guarionex that show some of the faces he managed to capture amidst all the commotion.
Jesús "Papoleto" Melendez, a poet born and raised in East Harlem, was chosen to be the emeritus king at the parade.

Osvaldo Gómez delighted us with his beautiful presence.

As part of our collaboration with Syria Deeply; we are cross-posting a series of articles that capture civilian voices caught in the crossfire, along with perspectives on the conflict from writers around the world.
Below is a conversation between News Deeply and a 20-year-old man who defected from the Syrian Army ’ s Sulas Military Base and joined the rebel side.
At his request, we will not use his name in this article.
We met at a house used by the FSA deep in the mountains of Jebel Turkman, in Latakia Province.
While bombs rattle the windows he shed light on the complicated mindset shared by many of Bashar al-Assad's soldiers: young men, forced into mandatory military stints, desperately wanting to join the opposition.
"It's my first time seeing a journalist or an American," he says shyly.
"I've been in the Syrian Army for one year. From the first time I joined, I wanted to defect — when I saw the FSA growing. Before I joined, I thought the revolution would end and Assad would win."
He says one shabiha minder was assigned to each new soldier, to ensure that they don't defect.
It comes after a recent stream of defections that apparently rattled the army's confidence.
"The soldiers, they're scared of the FSA.
A lot of them would like to defect, but the shabiha, they stay with us, they watch us like security so we don't go. "

The young soldiers hardly spoke of it among themselves.
"I would only talk about this with my family.
I couldn't speak of it with the others, though we all wanted to leave. My family is in Damascus, and they are all with the revolution. They are happy I left the army. "
He never wanted to shoot to kill the rebels he secretly supported, and says some of the army's soldiers came up with tactics to avoid causing serious harm.
"I would never do it … I'd shoot into the air, shoot everything but the fighters.
A lot of people do that — the guys watching don't notice.
"The officers have power and they keep saying, 'we'll be successful, we'll go back to our houses ’.
But the fighters, they know it's coming close. "
He served most of his army time in Idlib, and was stationed in the mountains of Latakia for the final two months.
In that time, he says, "I never had a vacation.
I never went to town. "Before he was brought in for our interview, I'd been concerned about my safety in speaking with him. How could the FSA battalion leader who introduced us guarantee that his new fighter wasn ’ t actually a double-agent, informing on us to the regime?
"I have spoken with his father in Damascus," the leader told me.
Trying to assure me, he said that given the security at the regime bases, and based on the physical terrain, only the most faithful of men manage to escape. He said "it is very, very difficult to defect."
On January 14, 2013 Cuba's historic migration reform went into effect, which should make it much easier to leave and enter the country.
According to the Havana Times, Cuban citizens can now apply for passports to travel out of the country for up to 24 months, without seeking special permission from the government.
The new regulations eliminate the previously required “exit permit ” and“ letter of invitation ” and relaxes rules for health care and sports professionals and those who migrated illegally. In addition, the grounds for repatriation have been expanded. For years, leaving the country, whether temporarily or permanently, has been the subject of dozens of posts in the Cuban blogosphere.
In August 2012, the author of "Los otros ojos de Eva" made reference to the "internationalist missions," government projects to provide aid to other countries, primarily in sectors such as education and health which also represent an economic relief for Cuban professionals.
However, Melisa Cordero also reminds us of the enormous human cost of years of separation for families:
You will cross the Atlantic and you will miss her immediately, throughout every second and even in your dreams, and you'll think you see her every time an African child, black-skinned and dirty, approaches you during a consultation. (...) Doubt will rush through your body, you are hesitant and your family: yes girl, go on, we'll look after her, and your husband with his sad face and without a word and with the fridge half empty and their needs beating your conscience. The journey will be soon.
My father left one afternoon, some time ago, maybe a little longer and we still haven't found out, exactly, in which part of the Caribbean to lay flowers. Since January 14 2013, Cuban citizens will be able to apply for passports at the offices of the Identity Card and Population Registry as well as at Immigration and Naturalisation to travel out of the country without being required to seek permission from the government.

According to a report from the Havana Times, which quotes the Office of Immigration and Naturalisation, a total of 195 sites have been set up for this purpose.
According to this digital magazine, "it is estimated that the historical reform will benefit a large number of Cubans who, as long as they can finance their journey and obtain a visa for the destination country, will be able to travel abroad with far greater ease."
However, "this will not imply a massive exodus from the island.
With regard to journeys towards the United States, an article published by the digital site Café Fuerte points out:
Cuba will allow its citizens to travel as emigrants and even to make use of the Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) in the United States without losing their rights as residents of the island for a period of two years, a high-level government official announced.
But some citizens, amongst them elite athletes, will still have to seek permission to leave the country. Moreover, the law includes a subsection which has been questioned by several bloggers.
Subsection "H", however, states that they will also not be able to travel "when for other reasons of public interest, the relevant authorities say so." A legal curiosity which does not clearly establish what these "reasons" or "authorities" may be (...)
Such an ambiguity gives absolute power to civil servants over the citizenry.
The lack of teachers could be considered to be a reason of public interest and the Ministry in question may consider itself to be the relevant body to prevent a teacher from travelling. However, the AP agency has published a report in which it reveals that "according to an anonymous informant, various hospital directors held a meeting on Saturday with the Ministry of Health, and were informed of a resolution which will allow the standardisation of travel for all sector personnel. ”
In turn, Manuel Henrique Lagarde commented on the situation of Cuban blogger Yoani Sánchez:
At the exit of the offices of the Department of Immigration and Naturalisation in the municipality of Plaza de la Revolución in 17 and K in El Vedado, the blogger, in declarations made to the foreign press, confirmed that she had requested a new passport and that she had been informed that after 15 working days, the time it would take to produce the document, she could leave the country. Hundreds of foreign media have reported the news and some users from other nations have celebrated the Cuban migration reform, although they point out:
The long-awaited removal of the obstacles imposed for decades on Cubans trying to leave their country came into force today, but with a high price, 100 dollars per passport, the most expensive in the region after Chile.
Cuban state television broadcast a programme with more details about the migration reform (in Spanish).

For this 2013 summer vacation, Argentinan have chosen Argentinian Patagonia as one of their favorite tourist destinations.
On its Tourism section, the newspaper Perfil explains that one of the reasons behind that choice has been the relatively fair prices and its diverse range of touristic attractions. But Patagonia is also a place for those eager to discover it on bycicle, as the bloggers from La Vida de Viaje (Life of Travel), who depict their journey, adventures as well as misfortunes on their blog:
After biking for a few hours to reach Tolhuin, we stayed for two days with the Ullua Family who contacted us through Facebook to get to know us and for us to have aplace to stay.
We found out that this village gives great value to bike-tourism.
Other Argentinan bloggers, like Juan and Laura from Acróbatas del Camino (Acrobats of the road), decided to travel by hitchhiking and ended up not only going through Patagonia, but the whole world.
In one of their posts, they share their experience in Puerto Madryn and their concern about the environment. Every year at the Península de Valdéz, it is possible to see the whales coming from the Southern Hemisphere, reaching the coasts of Patagonia in order to procreate:
Even before seeing the first whale, two thoughts haunted me.
The human being is like a voyeur celebrating species whose confinement fits in with the rest of their social habits.
There are some inconvenient truths, but fueling up tank of a car results in increasing the global warming which in turn reduces the concentration of the krill the whales feed.
The post goes further:
Of course, all tourists arrive by car and many would accept have one vehicle for each family member, if possible.
As it is obvious, you would need to drop kids at school.
To teach them to take care of environement, for example...

There are also bloggers, like the ones who contribute in Magia en el Camino (Magic on the road), who within the framework of the Proyecto Educativo (Educational Project) visit schools, hospitals, suburbs to perform magic tours:

In the early hours of New Year ’ s Day, the Colombian Armed Forces launched an air strike on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) camp located near Chigorodó northwestern Colombia.
The air strike was called after Elda Ramírez (aka ‘ Mayerly ’), considered a senior member of the FARC hierarchy, called a man who she believed was a drug dealer interested in buying cocaine.
The air strike also occurred against the backdrop of negotiations between the FARC and Colombian government that have been ongoing since September 2012.
To support the peace talks, the FARC announced a ceasefire on November 20.
On January 20, FARC announced that it had suspended the ceasefire and instead proposed a bilateral truce.
The Colombian government ’ s attack and the broken ceasefire provoked a variety of response from Colombian bloggers.
For instance, a blogger at Colombia Opina celebrated the bombings and explains why the FARC ’ s fifth front was so dangerous:
FARC's 5th front was some kind of school for terrorists.
From Efraín Guzmán to Iván Márquez, and to the now demobilized “Karina ” to the still armed rebel aka“ Manteco ” have all belonged to, an old, belligerent guerrilla structure, which in the early hours of December 31 received another blow by the Colombian Air Forces in 'Operation Fortune', a bombing which left at least 14 rebels dead and brings back the hope for security of the inhabitants in the strategic area known as the Banana Axis, which borders a corridor of the Abibe Mountains and crosses through Riosucio river to the middle of Atrato river.
In contrast, Camilo Raigozo criticizes President Santos' 'happiness' with the killing of the guerrilla fighters:
The regime headed by President Santos has refused to stop the bloody and deadly orgy which saddens the Colombian people, by not accepting a bilateral ceasefire, not even for the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
The insatiable bloodthirst of those in power prevents that.
Horacio Duque, on Tercera Información, wonders if the unilateral ceasefire by FARC has worked:
It seems, based on the data delivered by the experts who closely follow these combat operations, that in the first day the success has been resounding.
Combat operations and clashes went from 190 to 26 monthly, 23 of them with origin in groups not related to the talks in Cuba (...) Even oil and mining companies have reported a less hostile environment.
Fernando Dorado writes about the convenience of extending the ceasefire:
If the ceasefire period is kept or extended, beyond the holiday season, FARC guerrillas would be putting all the pressure on the government in order to agree to a bilateral ceasefire, which would make the peace process more convincing.
It seems that the reluctance of the Colombian government to respect the FARC ceasefire is intended to weaken the group both militarily and strategically.
In doing so, Bogota anticipate that the FARC will have less space to make demands. during the peace talks.
The effectiveness of this strategy will likely be determined over the course of 2013, especially as the November deadline for brokering a peace agreement approaches.

The city of Medellin is facing a difficult public order situation.
The most mentioned area is Comuna 13, with several nocturnal clashes on the first weekend of February.
The situation became so serious that Metrocable was forced to suspend its service for 15 minutes. Two people were injured by stray bullets that hit one Metrocable car.

In reaction to the events, two of the city's inhabitants, Juan Mosquera (@ lluevelove) and rapper Jeihhco (@ Jeihhco), took to Twitter to express their sadness and call for reflection.
Global Voices has gathered some particularly pertinent tweets below:
Juan Mosquera
@ lluevelove: Gunshots at night, silence in the morning, dust at midday, fear in the evening.
@ lluevelove: There is no silence that can keep the shots that boom out: their echoes are tombs.
@ lluevelove: All the city as one. All the city - united.
You and I have the skin intact, but we are both hurt, just like as the others you don't know.
Jeihhco
@ Jehhico: We hear shots ringing out once more, we don't know for how long Comuna 13 will burn, Medellín is on fire.
@ Jehhico: In the gunpowder gunshots are hidden, in life we sense death's gradual approach, sounds that ache in the heart, in the soul.
@ Jehhico: So may crap in the streets, it hurts, the silence that has fallen in the neighbourhood righ now is a hurting silence, terrifying, pure, underlying fear.
Alongside the above, the hashtag # Medelllinnotienealcalde began to trend, a springboard for Twitter users to discuss the problems in the city, which has been characterised by its vigour but also by a history of violence and which has recently been nominated for the title of most innovative city in the world:
Ramiro Velásquez (@ RamiroCiencia) writes:
# MedellinNOTieneAlcalde, it has a civil servants that does nothing but smile until he's asked about SECURITY PROBLEMS.
Eliana Castro (@ fermina _ dz) notes:
# MedellinNOTieneAlcalde, it has an agent for foreign artists.
Laura Albornoz Damme (‏ @ LauraAlbornozD), meanwhile, disagrees with the hashtag: Why # MedellinNOTieneAlcalde?
At least 14 people died and 80 are injured are up until now, the result of a strong blast that shook the state-owned company Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) on Thursday January 31st, 2013 in Mexico City, as it was informed by the company's official Twitter account:
@ pemex: Unfortunately, we have 14 persons confirmed dead and 80 injured
Some netizens, besides regretting the news, speculated on the true cause of the explosion.
Like Think Mexican (@ ThinkMexican), who pointed out on its Twitter account:
@ ThinkMexican: Torre de # Pemex explosion comes days after @ EPN responded to speculation his admin. sought to privatize Mexico's oil.http: / / ow.ly / 1RJUGC
Or the journalist and writter Raúl Tortolero (@ raultortolero1), who asked:
@ raultortolero1: Will we know with transparency what happened in # Pemex today, or are we only going to hear made up versions?
While other like Ana (@ AnaLargaespada) spoke about possible negligence:
@ AnaLargaespada: # Pemex facilities had already had 2 explosions http: / / www.eluniversal.com.mx / notas / 899965.html … (watch video).
This sounds to me like misshandling
And some others think it was the responsibility of the drug lords, like Jorge said (@ TwytterMx):
@ TwitterMx: The explosion at # Pemex headquarters same as the blast in # Reynosa are terrorist acts by drug gangs! # atendato (attack)
To which Huff Post Voices columnist Alejando Escalona (@ alexoescalona) concluded:
@ alexoescalona: I think it is good not to speculate if what happened in Pemex was an attack, but we shouldn't either asume it was an accident. # PEMEX
On the other hand, there were tasteless comments that many reacted to, like movie maker and columnist Mariano Bouchot (@ marianobouchot), who disapproved the jokes on the subject:
@ marianobouchot: I don't understand nor justify the jokes around the tragedy.
What happened today in # Pemex is not a jest. There were also many netizens who spread useful information.
Like, Fherb (@ LFernando24) who tweeted:
@ LFernandoo24: Help please: Blood donors needed at Pemex North Central Hospital in Azcapotzalco... # Pemex
And Maru Iniestra (@ 889Maru) shared a link with a report of the wounded: @ 889Maru: Spread the word...
Preliminary report of the wounded # Pemex http: / / www.presidencia.gob.mx / informacion-de-contingencia-de-pemex / … More information in @ locatel _ mx # LocatelInforma (Locatel Informs) 5658111
While a great number of netizens offer their condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, as the economist and blogger Guillermo Barba (@ memobarba):
@ memobarba: There's no doubt this blast at the # Pemex Tower was a tragedy.
My condolences to the victims' families. Pemex web page already a black ribbon as a mourning sign. Airview of the explostion at Pemex Tower in Mexico City.

Aftab the monkey before launch into the space.
Photo: IRNA
Bloggers and news sources have challenged claims by the Iranian government that they successfully launched a monkey into space and retrieved the animal alive on January 28, 2013.
Official images — supposedly depicting the monkey before and after the launch — do not appear to match up, casting further doubt and raising suspicions that the launch may have been fake.
Here is the official footage recorded from a national IRIB Channel 1 broadcast:
Many users on the popular Iranian link-sharing site, Balatarin, say the regime is lying and compare photos of the monkey from before the launch with a photo of the one claimed to have been retrieved from the capsule upon return, highlighting physical dissimilarities between the two.
Here they are:
As seen from the lead photo of this post, as well as the one above (right) the first monkey has a mole on its right eyebrow and has grey and shorter hair around the face, while the second monkey one has no mole and dark brown hair around the face.
Netizens reactions to this report range from total skepticism to conspiracy theories:
Iranian blogger 'Hagh mosalam ma' ('Our definite right') takes a satirical approach, and draws parallels between the alleged space mission with the 2009 Iranian presidential election that many consider was rigged.
He also jokes:
The monkey that was launched into space was buddy, the one that returned was acting weirdly.
Using Photoshop you can send monkeys to Mars, not to mention just outside the atmosphere.
Amir Farshad writes in his Blog 'Hot Chocolate' that:
Mahmood Ahmadinejad gave the nation more good news this week on the advent of Fajr festivities: "We launched a monkey into space and managed to perform an aesthetic surgery to remove his mole up there, and then returned him in good health to the arms of the Supreme Leader."
William Yau is a six-year-old Malaysian boy who was left in a car with his siblings while his parents went into an electrical appliances store on January 16.
According to reports, his sister Cindy started crying, prompting him to leave the car to look for his parents.
He never came back.
On Thursday, January 24, the body of a boy was found in a river.
Based on DNA results released on January 28, police have confirmed that it is indeed the body of William.
The search for William was triggered by the media using the NUR Alert and had then spread quickly online, with Malaysians posting banners and pictures on their blogs to help locate him.
Everyday people from Eliza Teh, to seasoned journalists like Nuraina Samad and Ahirudin Attan had used their blogs to bring attention to William ’ s case.
William Yau posters were shared on various social networking sites.
Photo from Facebook of hitz.fm KuchingEven now, there has been an outpouring of grief for William ’ s family on social media.
Joel recounted how he, too, was separated from his parents when he was a child.
I still remember the incident well; a 5 year old kid in his pajamas, wandering around the former City Square mall in KL (Kuala Lumpur).
My parents were doing their shopping at Metrojaya, and I was restless.
I walked off to the nearest Toys R 'Us without them knowing and before long, had gotten myself lost.
The fact that I'm writing this right now is proof enough that nothing untoward happened to me.
The same cannot be said of little William Yau.
The William Yau case, which has dominated headlines and various social networking sites has come to the worst conclusion possible.
Little William's badly decomposed body was found floating in a river in Klang, a week after the news of his disappearance set into motion a huge search for him.
I feel a heavy sense of grief weighing down on my person, I feel the pain of little William's family members, the pain of losing someone dear.
Netizens helped in spreading news about the search for the missing boy.
Photo from Tumblr of Made by MalaysiansNorliza Sani sympathised with William ’ s parents:
Parents' worst nightmare is losing a child.
We as parents usually have in mind that we are the ones to go first.
I guess we all know that death comes to anybody regardless of age, but no one is prepared when the situation actually happens.
My heart goes to the parent of William Yau.
May your child rest in peace.
I have a 6 year old son too, hope who ever did this to your son is caught and receive severe punishment. Malaysia has quite a number of missing children and not even one kidnapper is caught.
This is something you need to ponder.
It indeed worries and saddens you to think that these criminals are still at large. Many Malaysians, including celebrities and politicians, took to Twitter to express their grief.
@ SheilaMajid We r deeply saddened & share d grief on d demise of William Yau.May God give d family strength to deal with this & may he rest in peace. ☹
@ WardinaSafiyyah William Yau parents I am so sorry.
William Yau Zhen Zhong, went missing since Jan 16.: (Police fished out a 7 yr old body from Sungai Sireh
@ joannabessey Heartfelt condolences to William Yau & family.As people of Mlysia & the world, we MUST end this heinous treatment of children + human trafficking
@ drchuaSL our deepest condolences to William Yau's family and hope that the abductor / murderer will be arrested as soon as possible.
@ j1m0nz Deepest condolences to William Yau family # WilliamYau
Interestingly, as the official post-mortem have not yet been completed, many Malaysians appear to have concluded that it is a crime, calling for the perpetrator (s) to be brought to justice, probably because of the high-profile Nurin Jazlin Jazimin case.
The preliminary post-mortem results were deemed insufficient to determine the cause of death, and the police are not ruling out any theories, including that he fell into the drain or that he was killed then dumped into it.
However, they are re-recording statements from key witnesses due to certain inconsistencies.

Map of the maritime claims of Ecuador, Peru, and surrounding countries.
By Political Geography Now via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)
International boundaries are often blurred by the processes of globalization, but in South America some maritime borders remain contested.
For instance, Chile and Peru, neighbors that have enjoyed sustained economic development over the past few years, remain at odds over approximately 38,000 square kilometers of sea located along their maritime border.
Bilateral negotiations between the two countries were first held in 1980 but no agreement was reached.
In 2008, Peru took the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which, in turn, considered the issue at a public hearing in December 2012. The ICJ is expected to make a ruling on the dispute in mid-2013.
In the meantime, Peru continues to argue that the maritime border has not yet been defined by any agreement, with documents signed in the 1950s only relating to access to fishing grounds.
Lima also claims that maritime limits should run diagonally south-west from the land border.
Meanwhile, Chile argues that the maritime limits were agreed upon after the signing of treaties in 1952 and 1954.
These infer that the maritime border should run parallel to the Equator line, an arrangement that Santiago claims Peru has respected for the past 60 years.
Supporting the Chilean position, netizen Juan Vargas commented on Peru this Week:
The 1952 and 1954 agreements clearly indicate and establish a Maritime Boundary.
They can be found translated into English at: http: / / www.state.gov / documents / organization / 58820.pdf ”
Oscar Maúrtua de Romaña, a former Peruvian Minister of Foreign Affairs describes the arguments of both sides in a blog post on El Mirador, and concludes:
Despite historical differences, Peru and Chile share a common destiny.
A fair outcome by the court will end the "sole remaining border issue ” which compromises our bilateral relations.
It is reassuring that 72 hours before the start of the hearing (Peruvian) President Humala and (Chilean) President Piñera have made a joint statement in which both pledged to accept and follow the determination of the International Court of The Hague.
Landlocked Bolivia Awaits Decision
The dispute between Chile and Peru also has direct implications for others states around the region.
In particular, Bolivia is closely watching legal proceedings, and has previously stated that it plans to make a case at the ICJ for Chile to provide coastal access to the Pacific that was lost during the 1879-1881 between the two countries.
The final outcome at the ICJ case may add further impetus to Bolivia ’ s attempts to seek a diplomatic solution to this longstanding issue.
Regardless of the ICJ resolution, the democratic and diplomatic statements made by all parties have significantly reduced the risk of armed conflictbetween the parties.
This has, in turn provided the foundations for the development of more creative solutions aimed at ending the crises.
These include “A Maritime Zone of Bilateral Participation ” proposed by Jilmar Moisés Córdova:" A Maritime Zone of Bilateral Participation ".
This argues: The maritime dispute between Peru and Chile, can reach a possible solution by a so-called Maritime Zone Bilateral Involvement or Participation, which divide the seas of the two states and would be intended for fishing, the exploitation of resources by boats of a certain tonnage from both Peru and Chile. For instance, Argentina and Uruguay hold a treaty like this so that delimits their sovereign seas.
Córdova also considers that such an alternative could give both countries the chance of exploring and benefiting from mineral, oil and other resources.
He is also confident that the Maritime Zone Bilateral Involvement could provide alternative options for Bolivia ’ s coastal aspirations.

The blog La Oveja 100 reported on Monday, February 4:
The helicopter where Lino César Oviedo was traveling was located today (February 3, 2013) in a rural area in Paraguay, north of Asunción, with the bodies of its passengers “burnt to ashes ”, reported Radio 780 am from Asunción.
“Someone from the most intimate group of the presidential candidate confirmed his death ”, stated the radio station.
Oviedo led the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE, by its Spanish name), and was running for president for the general elections to be held on April 21, 2013. This will be the sixth election in the country since the coup that ended the dictatorship in February 1989.
About this, the blog E'a Periódico de Interpretación y Análisis makes a brief analysis of the Paraguayan political stage after Oviedo's death:
Without a doubt, Oviedo played an important role in the February 2 and 3, 1989 coup, but a moment of courage doesn't make a hero out of anyone, let alone when instead of courage what was there was probably recklessness, or when the moment could have reflected strict disagreements due to false interests within the dictatorial power.
Heroism means sustained conducts that mark positive stories; trying to make a hero out of someone who hasn't had those positive stories may just sound as opportunism by those who, as birds of prey, fly over the remains … Shameful effort of some political sectors to take Oviedo's votes for April 21.
Meanwhile, the blog InterParaguay republishes the announcement made by the government and the three days to mourn Mr Oviedo's passing away:
The Minister of Interior, Carmelo Caballero, on press conference in Mburuvicha Roga, announced the decision of the government of declaring a three-day period of mourning on official activities.
Besides that, he claimed investigations will be carried out in order to confirm the causes of the accident of the Robinson 44 helicopter that was transporting Mr Oviedo and two more passengers.
Also, Twitter users have been expressing themselves using the microbloggind site.
Fátima Garay (@ fatimagaray) mentions the remains of the victims of the accident:
@ fatimagaray: Medical team is making all efforts to hand over TODAY remains of victims of air tragedy to their famiies, among them Lino Oviedo.
And Anahí Tortorello (@ anahitorto) asks her:
@ anahitorto: @ fatimagaray today, without fail, will they hand over the remains? User Klaus Hiebert (@ KhaosXI) foresees: @ KhaosXI: Don't be surprised if we see the face of Lino Oviedo printed on one of those 200.000 or 500.000 checknotes.
Radio and TV anchorman Ismael Cala (@ CALACNN) expresses his awe:
@ CALACNN: My sympathy goes to family members and supporters of # Lino Oviedo, I interviewed him just six days ago on @ CALACNN.
It will be aired on Monday.
And then he announces:
@ CALACNN: Urgent: Tomorrow on @ CALACNN the unpublished interview recorded on Monday with Lino Oviedo.
The presidential candidate died in helicopter crash. # Paraguay
Lastly, Fernanda Bogado (@ FernandaAzuaga) said point-blank:
@ FernandaAzuaga: Don't play with Lino Oviedo's death!

It is often said that Mozambicans start the year "a marrabentar."
That's because every year, early February, the most representative festival of the country, the Festival of the Marrabenta, takes place.
Wherever you go, you hear "teka, teka! ”, the expression used while dancing to marrabenta, which has a contagious rhythm that makes it difficult not to get carried away.
But in Mozambique, talking about marrabenta music is also serious, because in every hypnotic beat, the country's colonial history and identity resonates.
The Festival of Marrabenta Music This time, from 1 to 3 February, 2013, the famous Congolese composer and singer Sam Mangwana and other Mozambicans musicians Dilon Djindji, Radio Marrabenta, Xidimingwana, Orquesta Djambo o Cheny Wa Gune, performed at the 6th edition of this festival held in the city of Maputo and in the towns of Marracuene and Matalene.
As every year, a train with live music departed from Maputo and took musicians and audiences to the village of Marracuene for free.
An hour and a half trip into the "Train of marrabenta", people also joined the Gwaza Muthini celebration which coincides with the event.

The Gwaza Muthini ceremony commemorates the famous battle of Marracuene which took place on February 2, 1895.
In this battle, the warriors of the Gaza Empire, under the command of Ngumgunhane, resisted the Portuguese colonial army.
The men of Ngumgunhane lost the battle and this was the beginning of the end of the Empire of Gaza.
In the past, a hippopotamus was hunted and its meat was distributed among the population to commemorate the event.
Today, hippopotamus meat has been replaced by goat meat which is often enjoyed with a local moonshine called "canhu" - consumed while dancing to the sound of the marrabenta.
The history and evolution of the marrabenta was not smooth.
It emerged in the south of Mozambique at the end of the 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1960s that it became more popular.
Multiracial and multicultural policies within the Portuguese colonies in Africa, facilitated its expansion in Mozambique and in its metropolis.
The arrival of the first gramophones from South Africa and the emergence of local music broadcasts also contributed to its diffusion.

Music of Struggle
The Portuguese regime in Mozambique demanded that they sing and dance only Portuguese music during most of the colonial period.
To defend their cultural identity, various organisations were born, such as the African Association (AA) and the associative Center of Blacks from the Province of Mozambique (CANPM), which ended up playing a fundamental role in the promotion of Mozambican culture.
In this way, marrabenta became a music of struggle whose themes are inspired by the experiences of everyday life, love, social criticism and important events that took place in Mozambique.

Evolution of Marrabenta
This rhythm was first played with homemade four-string guitars made from empty cans and pieces of wood.
The mixture of the magikay and zukuta rhythms from the South of the country and the assimilation of western rhythms such as the American and South African black music coming to the former Lourenço Marques (today Maputo), enriched this new genre.
It had no name until 1930 but finally adopted the name of the marrabenta.
Sam Mangwana from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, (formerly Zaire, when he was born) came to the festival for the first time this year.
Marrabenta's Festival, 2013. Poster shared on afribuku.
It's been five years since the first edition of the Festival of the Marrabenta, thanks to the initiative of Litho Sithoe.
And five years later, the festival continues through the determination and perseverance of its organizer.
On February 3 the festival ended with a concert at the Cultural Center of the town of Matalane.
This day is celebrated the "Day of the Mozambicans Heroes", a national holiday that commemorates the lives of the fallen soldiers who fought bravely for the country's independence in 1975.
The finishing touch to end a weekend breathing, living and feeling the marrabenta.
No one can predict the future of the marrabenta nor can they decipher how the style will evolve in modern times, if it will take paths towards more commercial sound.
But what is clear is that in this 6th edition, entertainment was guaranteed.
Whereas Norway and Switzerland are planning to hold referenda before submitting their 2022 Winter Olympics bids, the fate of the Slovak-Polish joint bid already seems decided: the Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has declared his support for it, without waiting for the government's approval.
Slovakia's Olympic expenditures were initially estimated at €200 million, but later the Minister of Finance spoke of €300 million, while some estimates amount to nearly €500 million.
Slovak NGOs, such as Aliancia Fair-Play, and the opposition parties are demanding the precise cost analysis and a list of funding sources.
Economist Richard Ďurana thinks that the "organization of the Olympic Games is a very expensive, short-term boost of national pride that only very rich or very irresponsible countries can afford."
Imrich Body, a member of the non-parliamentary 99 Percent-Civic Voice party, sees the Olympics as another attempt to "feed the Gorilla", referring to the corruption scandal that shook Slovakia a year ago.
Blogger Matej Bórik has these questions for the Prime Minister:
How do you ensure that there will be no overcharge scenario as in London, Athens, Sochi, Vancouver and other mega-cities? What steps will you take when it will occur?
Do you have enough cash in personal account?
Blogger Samo Marec writes:
It should be noted that we have already been fighting for the Olympics - and even twice. It is possible that I'm alone with this opinion, but I strongly believe that the sole purpose of the is making public money private once again.
Compared to this plan, is a poor amateur.
Blogger Karol Šebo is optimistic:
Poland, not Slovakia, will play the leading role in convincing the International Olympic Committee.
Poland, which has only recently organized EURO 2012 successfully; Poland, which has a strong lobby in a number of organizations around the world.
And not to mention that Krakow has a strong brand image internationally.
That's why I think that this joint candidacy has a real chance to be successful, and any success provides Slovakia with a great chance to become more visible, something that does not happen often.
Blogger Tomáš Bosák writes:
A candidate to host the Olympics now, when we are languishing? What do we need the Olympics for? I am just wondering from where this or that government will have the money for this parade.
Because I remember what a show it was about and how it kept growing more expensive.
Now it would not be enough to build just one stadium.
I don't know, it reminds me of organizing May Day celebrations.
No calculations, no documentation, but let's do it, because people will have fun.
And we will have a chance to show off.
Mikuláš Huba, an ecologist and a newly-elected MP, writes:
There is a threat to the nature, because the Tatras are not the Alps.
Not giving money to doctors and teachers, but giving it to officials, politicians, developers and sponsors?
The candidacy for the Olympics is such a serious decision that it cannot and should not be made by one person and in one day; it requires a serious, long-term and informed debate not just in the parliament, but in the society as a whole, following the example of Norway.
Prime Minister has openly demonstrated how serious he is about the consolidation of the public finances and also what (and who) his priorities are.
Sadegh Larijani, head of the judiciary, for years put into practice Islamic sharia and ordered many young men's hands and feet amputated.
You only need to make a simple search in Google to see the number of people whose hands and feet were amputated.
Will Sadegh Larijani punish his brother in the same way with all the evidence available?
Will his fingers be amputated in Azadi Stadium?
Or may Islam forbid punishment for people who steal billions and only punish petty thieves?
Anadrbab has published five photos of the Larijani brothers and compared them with The Dalton brothers, the fictional outlaws of the Lucky Luke comics.
The blogger asked the same question
Will Fazel Larijani be punished and his fingers be amputated like those of others, or is punishment only for petty thieves?
Last Friday, 8th of February, 2013, thousands of people started to gather since morning in Shahbagh's Projonmo Chottor (Generation Square) in solidarity with bloggers and online activists' ongoing protests.
On 3: 00PM the mass gathering in Bangladesh capital Dhaka started with singing the national anthem.
It is really hard to tell how many people gathered for peaceful protests on that day.
Many opined that almost 200,000 people joined in solidarity with the protest for stricter punishment of the war criminals.
The Bloggers and online activists Network has been leading these protests continuously since last Tuesday.
Many students, teahcers, freedom fighters, civil society leaders and families of the war martyrs joined this protest.
The protesters are sharing their demands and news of different protest events via an informative website titled Shahbag.org.
In that site they are also informing about protests across the world in solidarity with their demands.
People can get updates following Twitter hashtags # Shahbagh and # Shahbag.
The protests in Shahbag are also being livestreamed intermittently which you can watch.
The latest addition is a streaming radio broadcasting the speaches and slogans live.

At Shahbagh, the youth are taking charge and pushing politics aside for the fourth day running.
Thousands of protesters continue to occupy the main intersection in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka demanding capital punishment for Abdul Quader Mollah, a leader of the Islamist party and other individuals being tried for war crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war.
They have waited 42 years for the accused to be tried, many of whom are now politicians with the Islamist party Jamaat-e Islami, and they say they won't back down till they believe justice is served.
Since its a Friday and a holiday, a huge crowd is expected to join the protests.
A youth lead mass gathering will take place at 3: 00PM in Shahbagh. The Blogger and Activists Network, Cultural Activists and Youth Organizations will address the mass gathering.
No political slogan / speeches will be allowed.
Political organizations are requested not to bring any political banners.
The organizers have requested students from schools and colleges to join.
The Shahbagh protests are being live streamed by youth activists Shourov Hassan, Mahmudul Amin and Fahim Mahmud.
You can watch the live stream here.

At the end of 2012, the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture made public its plans to provide free mobile phones to rural farmers.
According to this report:
Ibukun Idusote, Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, was reported as saying that the Federal Ministry of Agriculture would procure ten million mobile phones, worth about N60 billion, from China and the US for free distribution to rural farmers across the country.
This triggered reverberations in the Nigerian blogosphere. Kikiowo Ileowo asks where the government got the statistics – that warrants 10 million mobile phones for 10 million farmers – from: The question … is where exactly are the 10million farmers?
Are they from the army of the unemployed 16, 074, 295 or from the already employed 51, 181, 884.
If their answer is the former, what exactly are they producing that Nigeria has not become a hub of everything food?
Now, understand that a large portion of food production in Nigeria is done through mechanized farming which makes use of less manual labour.
The 'farmers' Mr. President wants to provide handset for are subsistent farmers who produce what they mostly consume in their homes.
I have a garden at the back of my house; does that qualify me as a recipient of the 'Jona-phone'?
I see no reason why the president in conjunction with his minister of Agriculture would insult the collective intelligence of Nigerians by playing to the gallery with a noble idea that has revolutionised countries like Uganda, Kenya and India.
There has since been a correction on the real cost of the phones:
… the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, has corrected the report that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mrs. Ibukun Odusote, said the phones would be bought by the government at the cost of N60 billion, his explanation that the phones will be supplied to farmers through Public / Private Sector partnership …
Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture
Dr Adesina, the Minister of Agriculture rose up in defence of the project.
In a press release he says:
When I came on board as minister of agriculture in July of 2011, I found a corrupt and totally inefficient fertilizer sector.
The government was spending huge amounts of money on direct procurement and distribution of subsidized fertilizer, but less than 11% of farmers got the fertilizers.
Some of the fertilizers paid for by government were never delivered to the warehouses.
Some of the fertilizer delivered contained more sand than fertilizer while a large portion of the fertilizer subsidized by government found its way across our borders to neighbouring countries where it was sold at prevailing market prices.
This technology-mediated solution, he asserts, ended the corruption associated with fertilizer distribution:
We ended four decades of corruption in the fertilizer sector within 90 days of my assumption of office as minister.
How did we do this?
We were able get subsidized high quality fertilizer and seeds to our rural farmers by introducing the GES (Growth Enhancement Support) scheme in April of 2012.
The GES scheme delivers inputs (fertilizers and seeds) to farmers directly by using farmers' cell phones.
We created an electronic platform (e-wallet) on which we registered farmers and agro dealers who own shops that sell farm inputs all over the country.
To date we have registered 4.2 million farmers and about 900 agro dealers.
The Minister thinks that although many Nigerian farmers are illiterate but are able to use mobile telephones:
Some people think that our farmers are uneducated and cannot use cell phones.
The evidence does not support that.
Under the GES scheme, we made it possible for farmers to transact business in their own local languages using their cell phones.
From data we collected based on farmers ’ use of cell phones to access fertilizers and seeds last year, we found that the total number of transactions done by phone with respect to the GES scheme was 4.9 million.
Of these, 1.2 million were in English, 620,000 were in Pidgin, 2.2 million were in Hausa, and 854,000 were in Yoruba and 344 were in Igbo.
From this data, we have no doubt that our farmers are well able to use cell phones.
Technology, according to the Dr Adesina, aided his judgement that there would be no food crisis after floods swept through some parts of the country:
When the floods occurred, there was panic in the land... I was not moved.
We used modern technology to guide our decision.
Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, we mapped out the extent of the flood and determined that no more than 1.17% of our total cultivated area was affected by the floods.
Our detractors wanted the world to believe the opposite, that food crisis was imminent.
They were wrong.
Today, five months after the floods, we do not have a food crisis.
Nonetheless, some netizens still have unanswered questions.
Olusola Adegbeti asks:
One must then poignantly ask, though it be a rhetorical question, if the purchase and distribution of GSM phones to hundreds of farmers spread across the length and breadth of a country so large as Nigeria is the most critical and challenging of issues bedevilling the Nigerian agricultural sector at the moment?
Your guess is as good as mine. Running on the heels of the above, it is convenient to say that one does not need the wisdom of Solomon or the prophetic insight of Isaiah to be led in the direction of the myriad of issues that have since rendered the agricultural sector beggarly, issues such as lack of easy access to land for farming, absence of reliable and corruption-free financial institutions to empower farmers acquire the required modern machinery for mechanised and commercial farming that is usually the backbone of every nation, lack of easy access to requisite technology and agro-chemical support-structure for sustained annual and perennial farming as well as animal husbandry....
The Sun asks if farmers really need new mobile phones, when they already have one or have other sources of information?
The telephone is also clearly not the best way to reach farmers who mostly live in the rural areas.
Rural information centres, traditional communication models and the radio are much better channels.
There are also many more direct initiatives through which the government can boost agricultural production in the country, than provision of telephones.
More importantly, the government does not need to buy telephones for farmers because those among them who could use such phones, already have them.
With handsets selling for as low as between N2000 and N3000 in the country, any farmer that is worth the name can afford to own one, and most likely has one already.
If they do not, what the government needs to do is to empower them to be able to afford such a basic tool.
Disu Kimor thinks that it ’ s another white elephant project:
Such white elephant projects will only reinforce the perception of Nigeria as a laughing stock of the rest of the world where we like to teach the blind sign language.
Any developing country such as Nigeria, wishing to develop its agricultural sector will focus direct government intervention to help farmers and boost food production on achieving steady supply of working capital, improve research and development, water supply, ensure low cost of fuel and labour, (corruption-free) subsidy on farming equipment and basic infrastructure.
Disu concludes:
One day, posterity will judge the quangos and political leaders of this country whose main pre-occupation is keeping the country on its knees or embezzle and waste much needed public funds.

An ongoing discussion over at the Uncultured Project has been the relationship between the lack of knowledge on what Islam is about and how aid and development organizations relate to the Muslim community.
Shawn Ahmed shares a simple and short video explaining what Islam is in an attempt to pave the road to better understanding of a large group of people who could be aid recipients.
In Shawn Ahmed's 7 April, 2012, post Aid Work, Cynicism, and Islam he points out to yet another post from a Muslim on what Islam is about, and it excludes cynicism as well as respecting others.
I wish more aid workers (especially aid workers that serve in countries where there are a lot of Muslims) understood this and respected it. Because, especially in online conversations about aid and development, there seems to be a penchant towards cynicism.
In a November 2012 post, Islam and Online Aid and Development Discourse he reflects on how online aid discussions exclude minorities, even when those minorities are the target for those same aid initiatives being discussed.
And he believes that one of the reasons for this exclusion could be because of the tone of these aid conversations not reflecting cultural norms, and this could be impacting the bad image the aid industry is garnering, particularly in the case of a mostly Muslim nation like Bangladesh:
This exclusion can happen simply because of the snark, sarcasm, and personal attacks that are frequently thrown around in online aid conversations...
If this tone is condoned and applauded by those working to help the poor …. then they may be right.
In the Uncultured Project's latest post Islam: 101 Ahmed proposes that a better understanding of the culture in the communities aid organizations are targeting, could provide a better environment for these same aid organizations, where instead of rejecting work with a certain group of people due to ignorance and discrimination, they could learn about the culture and work from this knowledge.

In an attempt to set the record straight and fix a common spelling error among English-language speakers, four young Colombian professionals from the digital innovation firm Zemoga launched the social media campaign "It's Colombia, NOT Columbia."
As Richard Emblin explains in a post for The City Paper:
We are geographically far from British Columbia and a shuttle age that endured many missions after the ‘ Columbia ’ disintegrated over Texas in 2003.
Yet many still get it wrong.
There are no Rocky Mountains in Colombia.
We are in the Andes.
But the campaign's mission goes beyond getting people to spell the name of the country correctly.
Paul Giles explains in the Colombia Travel blog:
The “It ’ s Colombia, not Columbia ” campaign is steadily building up steam in its crusade to demonstrate how the misspelling of a country just highlights how skewed the popular conception of this amazing country is.
Emilio Pombo, one of the campaign's founders, told Edgar Zúñiga from NBC Latino:
Colombia is becoming a destination and getting on the world stage.
We want to spotlight that and it all starts with people spelling our country ’ s name right. ”
A social media campaign wants you to say it right: "It's Colombia, not Columbia".
Image widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.
Supporters are encouraged to participate in the campaign by creating an image or a video to spread the message.
Participants can then share their contribution on Twitter or Instagram under the hashtag # itsColombiaNOTColumbia, or upload their work to the campaign's fan page on Facebook.
Positive messages about Colombia and pictures with the message "It's Colombia, not Columbia" have been flooding the hashtag and Facebook page.

But the campaign has not been free from criticism or jokes.
Nicolás Martínez (@ diarionocturno) and others have been playing with the campaign's slogan:
@ diarionocturno: It's poor, not developing # ItsColombiaNotColumbia In a more serious tone, Journalist Carolina Ruiz (@ CaroRuizG) argues: @ CaroRuizG: What's the point of people saying Colombia and not Columbia if everything else stays the same.
We have to change the substance more than the form.
While El gato (@ elgatoninja) tweets with irony:
@ elgatoninja: What's important is not that the kidnappings, killings, or deaths caused by famine stop. That they call us Colombia instead of Columbia, that's important.
And Paula Ricciulli (@ RicciuP) writes:
@ RicciuP: If you call all Asians "Chinese" you don't have the right to complain that they call Colombia "Columbia".

Nearly five weeks ago, Beijing experienced its worst day of air quality on record: Levels of PM2.5 — small particulates that can cause lung, cardiovascular and respiratory disease — soared to more than 30 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.
Air Quality in China — A Snapshot
Since then, reporting on China ’ s “airpocalypse ” has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country ’ s iconic cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin — all smothered in thick smog.
Indeed, China ’ s most populous and prosperous cities are among the epicenters of this latest pollution crisis.
In Tianjin, for instance, levels of PM2.5 hit 577 on February 9, the eve of the Chinese New Year.
In Beijing, sales of New Years ’ fireworks dropped 37% after the municipal government asked residents to limit their use.
But air quality in China is also a nationwide problem — a predicament that affects cities with far less name recognition than Beijing or a Shanghai.
Last week, the People ’ s Daily reported that of the 74 key cities monitored by China ’ s Ministry of Environmental Protection, all 74 reported “excessive ” PM2.5 concentrations on February 10, the first day of the Chinese New Year.
And as a glance at pollution figures from this morning shows, hazardous air conditions remain in cities throughout China, from Urumqi (with a PM2.5 concentration of 511 micrograms per cubic meter, or 20 times the recommended limit) to Guangzhou.

When the socio-political website OpenSpace was shut down in February, some claimed that it was a move against its editor-in-chief Maksim Kovalsky.
This made a certain amount of sense, since before helming OpenSpace, Kovalsky ran the journal Kommersant Vlast '(Power), a position he was canned from for publishing a photograph of a presidential election ballot marked with the words "Putin, go f * ck yourself".
Now, less than a month later, there are new dismissals.
Two editors-in-chief lost their positions on March 4, 2013: Mikhail Kotov left one of Russia's biggest online newspapers, Gazeta.ru, while Alexey Vorobiev is no longer the head of the Kommersant FM, a Kommersant affiliated radio station with a heavy online presence.
It's hard to overlook the similarities, not the least of which is the fact that both editors were dismissed on the same day by a man named Dmitry Sergeev.
Rather implausibly, it was two completely unrelated Dmitry Sergeevs who did the dismissing.
Yes, there are two high level media executives named Dmitry Sergeev in Russia, and they chose the same day to shake up their staff, prompting a Twitter user to quip "Russian media have established a special position - dmitry sergeev."
One of these Dmitry Sergeevs, a top official at SUP (parent company of both Gazeta.ru and LiveJournal) explained his side of the story in a Facebook post, citing a company planning session during which Kotov was essentially sidelined:
This morning at the planning session I was appointed the executive director of Gazeta.ru with direct oversight of all departments.
Earlier all departments were subordinate to the editor-in-chief and he was responsible for everything that happened in Gazeta.
Now, according to the new chain of command, the editorial, marketing, and commercial departments are directly subordinate to to me.
Mikhail Kotov disagreed categorically, saying that he can't continue working under these conditions and asked to resign.
Sergeev later elaborated, noting that the productivity of the publication was lagging, publishing only "100 news stories per day."
He also mentioned that he had no desire to change the editorial direction of the newspaper.
However, according to Anton Nosik (formerly a SUP employee), faced with such an ultimatum Kotov had no choice but to quit.
While Gazeta.ru is not particularly oppositionary in spirit, Kotov's relative independence (he has been in charge for more than a decade) was apparently viewed as a threat by the owners.
Why?
Journalist Vladimir Shusharin took a guess:
I've repeatedly written and said that these days quality journalism, especially economic journalism, is sharper, deeper, smarter, and in the end, more oppositionary than the pathetic and mediocre performance of those who have assumed the mantle of democratic opposition
The other Dmitry Sergeev, president of the Kommersant Publishing House, stayed away from social media, explaining to newspapers that Alexey Vorobiev resigned for "personal reasons."
He also made a point of mentioning that the editorial line of Kommersant FM will remain unchanged.
Even if true, some may view Vorobiev leaving as the final nail in the coffin of old, rebellious radio station.
After all, he was the deputy editor to the previous editor-in-chief, Denis Solopov, who left last summer amid claims that Kommersant owner Alisher Usmanov disliked the publication's criticism of the government.
For those still not sure of the general import of these resignations, the reaction of Boris Yakemenko, old-guard Putinist and brother to the founder of NASHI, should be most telling:
The process of healing of Russian mass media is continuing. It's worth noting that Kommersant and Gazeta.ru were founded by Berezovsky. His traditions in these publications remain largely intact, and are characterized by constant snickering, anti-Russian editorial positions, and bias.
Perhaps editors like Kovalsky, Kotov and Vorobiev no longer feel welcome in the brave new media market.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa (@ MashiRafael), decreed three days of national mourning after the death of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.
At the press conference that he gave from the Carondelet Palace, Correa said that "those who fight for life cannot declare themselves dead".
The Head of State said that with Chávez's passing, Latin America has lost a great leader and he affirmed that those who fight for their country cannot be forgotten.
“As a tribute to his departure, to his life, Ecuador decrees three days of national mourning.
From the place where you find yourself now, beloved Hugo, you have our promise to continue moving forward, towards that Great Country which our liberators dreamed about ”, said President Rafael Correa.
Activist Mónica Chuji (@ Monicachuji), for her part, wrote on Twitter:
@ Monicachuji: As a human, politician and defender of human rights, I express the solidarity I feel for the family of President Chávez and his people.

Sukhumbhand Paribatra of the opposition Democrat Party was re-elected as Bangkok governor despite exit polls predicting his defeat in the elections.
Bangkok Pundit provides an initial analysis of the voting numbers:
E. This is also the closest election in terms of narrowest margin (180,000 vs 292,402 in 2004) or% (6.5% vs 12.3% in 2004). F. The vote for independents drops to less than 300,000 votes or 11.28%.
As is happening nationally, Thailand is becoming more of a two-party system.

Using the # bkkvote hashtag, below are some reactions of Thai netizens
@ Tinapotjanank If I were a bangkokian, I would vote for Suharit (no.17) anyway congrats to Sukhumbhand, four more (boring) years...
@ tulsathit Oh, before I go, the much-taunted Sukhumbhand seems to have broken Samak Sundaravej's record as the biggest vote gatherer.
‏ @ Saksith If I'm not mistaken, Bangkok and one other province are the only ones where the Governor is elected, the rest appointed.
Praj Kiatpongsan observes the scene in the headquarters of the defeated party:
The atmosphere at the Pheu Thai party headquarters on Petchburi Road turned bitter as some supporters of Pongsapat angrily punched a TV screen, screamed profanity and pointed their fingers at the face of MR Sukhumbhand Partibatra, who was addressing a victory speech live from the Democrat Party headquarters.
Suthichai Yoon urges polling agencies to revise their techniques:
Various polling agencies must now conduct some serious soul-searching and to revise their polling techniques which have now been proven seriously flawed.
It would take quite a while before any trust in all those well-known polls could be restored.
And they must admit that it's unfair and unprofessional to blame it all on the respondents who have been accused of the pollsters of having "lied" to the volunteers seeking their views.

Argentinian Jesuit Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the new Pope of the Catholic Church.
Starting today, March 13, 2013, Bergoglio will be known around the world as Pope Francis.
Netizens were quick to react to the announcement that for the first time an Argentinian, and a Latin American, will be leading the Catholic Church.
From Buenos Aires, Rodrigo Hernán Torres (@ RodrigoH _ Torre) wrote:
@ RodrigoH _ Torre: # Bergoglio is our Pope, CONGRATULATIONS!
And I wish him all the best in this new challenge and path which is just starting, during a historic time.

Several users have been relating the news to football, like Aaron Zamost (@ zamosta) who referred to Diego Armando Maradona's "hand of God":
Even US-based TV presenter Piers Morgan (@ piersmorgan) had something to say about Argentinian football:
@ piersmorgan: Argentina now has the No1 Catholic, and No1 footballer, on the planet. # Bergoglio # Messi
On a more serious note, Caren Kalafatich (@ CarenKalafatich) tweeted:
@ CarenKalafatich: We are from Argentina, and this is our essence: We celebrate a "Pope" because he is "Argentinian" and we don't talk about # Bergoglio as a man and his conservatism.
Several users are questioning the new Pope's alleged involvement in Argentina's 1976-1983 dictatorship, like Guillermo Prein (@ GuillermoPrein):
@ GuillermoPrein: Cadinal # Bergoglio elected Pope in spite of his unexplained participation in the last dictatorship and the "fence" around pedophiles like Grassi
We will bring you more coverage of citizens' reactions and analysis from Argentina and Latin America.
Stay tuned.
While the world was waiting for the result of the election of the new pope, Argentinians were hopeful a fellow countryman would become the pope.
The white smoke at the Vatican announced the decision was made: the first jesuit and the first Argentinian pope, Jorge Bergoglio -now Francis- would become the maximum authority of the Catholic Church after Benedict XVI.
On Twitter, Argentinians spoke about it using different hashtags, like # Bergoglio, # HabemusPapam, # PrimerasPalabrasDelPapa (Pope's first words), # LaBarraDelPapa (Pope's fans), # FranciscoI, among others.
The reactions have been diverse.
For many it was a surprise, like for @ JessyDelPino who said: @ JessyDelPino: What??
@ LuuceroAguirre: The truth is I cannot believe it, I'm not a believer or anything, but it is really a PRIDE to FINALLY have a pope the way it has to be! # Bergoglio
In the blog Politics and Politicians Rosa Alcántara re-published an article that talked about the tumultuous relationship between Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's government and the new pope.
The former bishop and the head of state have had their differences on many issues, for example gay marriage:
One of the issues that had Cardinal Bergoglio against the government was the Gay Marriage Law project.
On July 9th, 2010, days before its approval, an open letter by Bergoglio said that gay marriage was a war against God which also contemplated the possibility of child adoption by gay couples.
Another clash happened during the May Revolution celebration, a national holiday that takes place every year and includes the traditional Tedeum at Buenos Aires' Cathedral.
In 2008, nonetheless, the Argentinian president decided to change the location.
The blog Radio Cristiandad commented (Radio Christianity) on this event:
Even though the government fulfilled the paperwork needed to change it, the decision to do it in Salta, where a multi-religion prayer will be held, generated anxiety among church groups.
The government said it was to "federalize" the national holiday. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner will also ditch, as her late husband did during his presidency, a contesting homily from the Argentinian church leader, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, during the May 25th Tedeum.
Argentinians also remember that during the operation that former president Néstor Kirchner had in 2010, Kirchner's family prevented Bergoglio's representative to administer the sacrament.
Others, like Gladys Lopreto in the blog Igualdad Dignidad (Dignity Equality), criticized the reactions of the Argentinian Episcopate on issues like abortion.
Meanwhile, far from politics, many Argentinians celebrated the good news.

@ AracelliCres:: Event the # Vaticano (Vatican) realized that we are the best of the world # OrgulloArgentino (Argentinian Pride) # Bergoglio Chants have also emerged, like Miko's (@ Emi _ Eguiazu) who celebrated that the new pope is Argentinian and not Brazilian, clearly referring to the football rivalry between the two countries:
As for the government's relationship with Bergoglio, Gabi (@ GabiManducaa) "chanted":
@ GabiManducaa:: Yo 'Cristina, yo' Cristina, you seem so bitter, the pope is not kirchnerist, what the hell will you do? # LaBarraDelPapa
And others considered that Francis I could free them from their sins, like Julian (@ MatilaFonte) who tweeted:
@ MatilaFonte: Yo 'Bergolio, yo' Bergolio, we won't tell you more, this year everybody sins, anyway you'll forgive us # LaBarraDelPapa
On the other hand, president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner shared on her Twitter account (@ CFKArgentina) a note congratulating his Sanctity Francis I.

Hello, World - welcome to a special edition of the Global Voices Podcast.
On Tuesday, March 12, 2013 the college of cardinals assembled at the Vatican to elect the new head of the Roman Catholic church, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 28.
On Wednesday evening the Cardinal Protodeacon emerged onto the central balcony as St. Peter's Basilica and uttered the words "Habemus Papam!"
("We Have a Pope!"), and presented Pope Francis. With two African cardinals considered at one point to be potential successors to Pope Benedict XVI, we spoke with Steve Sharra and Abdoulaye Bah from our Africa team about the possibility of an African pope, the continent's expectations of the next pope, and why cardinals at this week's papal conclave might have played games like volleyball.
Global Voices has a cardinal!

What is it like to be a student at the Indigenous University of Venezuela?
Three students from the department of edu-communication recently took part in a workshop led by Rising Voices in order to learn how to take better digital photographs and how to upload and share them on the internet
These three students are part of an effort to showcase this unique university designed to provide an intercultural and experimental form of education to students from Venezuela's indigenous communities.
By accessing the university's satellite connection, which was provided by the government program called Infocentros, the students are able to access the internet to share images of activities, facilities, and the stunning nature that surrounds the 2,000-hectare campus located in the state of Bolívar.
To read more about the university and the workshop held in February 2013, please read the post on the Rising Voices blog.
These are some of the photographs taken by the students and uploaded to the university's Flickr account.

Argentine football has not been immune to the joy sparked by the appointment of Pope Francis; His Holiness Francis is a fan and an active member of football club San Lorenzo de Almagro, known in Argentina as the "crows" or the "cyclone."
The club's nickname, "crows," is not by accident.
The website Goal.com explains the reason for the name:
@ aletati2007: # vamos (come on) cyclone!! this really has being our HOLY week!!!!
Hector Pappa (@ hectorPappa) tweeted that there's a party at the Vatican, and Felipe CQ (@ FelCul) said that Pope Francis scored the only goal at the game.
According to Diego Mendoza (@ diegol _ 77), San Lorenzo's victory is Pope Francis' first miracle.
At least one person was killed and five injured on March 29 in a major fire at the Vuhlehirska Thermal Power Plant in the town of Svitlodarsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region.
Some 12 hours later, the fire was still raging, the plant's four power-generating units were destroyed, and the town's 12,000 residents were left without heating, hot water and electricity.
Bedridden patients of the local hospital were evacuated to the nearby town of Debaltsevo, according to Donetsk-based LJ user pauluskp (Pavel Kolesnik, ru), who has been re-posting videos and photos and sharing updates on the situation on his blog.
Kolesnik / pauluskp posted this video of the first minutes of the fire, recorded by the plant's employees at the time "when the flames still did not appear too dangerous":
According to the official information, the fire started around 3 PM. In a comment to pauluskp's post, however, LJ user hannaukr writes that the fire actually broke out around noon, but the plant's employees spent the next three hours trying to extinguish it on their own, before finally summoning the firefighters.
LJ user kotya1975 adds:
As a former firefighter, I agree that there would've been a lot more chances had the professionals become involved right away.
Alas, now the plant is definitely doomed, and it's important not to allow the fire to spread to nearby buildings.
Kolesnik / pauluskp writes that the future of the town of Svitlodarsk, home of the damaged thermal plant, is one of the main concerns right now:
It doesn't appear likely that the plant would be rebuilt. might get yet another dying ghost town.
Something similar happened with the town of Ukrainsk. Neither the, nor the town itself managed to recover after at the coal mine. Kolesnik / pauluskp links to his own photo report from Ukrainsk, which was later re-posted and translated into English by English Russia blog.
Reporting about drug-related crime in Mexico can be fatal.
Journalists and citizens are threatened and even killed for reporting on the violence that has overtaken the country.
In spite of the danger, many Mexicans are using civic media to inform the public about shootings, harassment, murders and arrests, filling the informative space that the country's mainstream media has abandoned.
Sara Plaza Écija summarized the findings of a new study of the role of citizen journalists as "new war correspondents" in Mexico in the website Periodismo Ciudadano (Citizen Journalism).

An American study that aimed to analyze digital innovation found that Mexican Twitter users have become a reliable source of information about topics related to the country's drug trade, taking on the role of traditional mainstream media.
According to the document “The New War Correspondents: The Rise of Civic Media Curation in Urban Warfare, ” Twitter users in cities like Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz or Saltillo are in charge of informing the public about arrests, shootings and confrontations caused by the Mexican drug trade, thus taking on the informative characteristics and role of traditional forms of media and communication.
This information has become increasingly influential for Mexican citizens as the nation's major media outlets continue to lose credibility.
The study, supervised by Microsoft Research, examines the means of information exchange between people living in the cities most affected by the war on drugs in Mexico.
It describes the frequency with which citizens use social media to warn others about violence in their communities.
The study also investigates the rise of civic media “curators ”, or citizens acting as" war correspondents "in terms of spreading information.
“This is a group of people, who we refer to as ‘ curators ’, who have a large number of followers on social media networks, which means they've gained the trust of their communities, ” said Andrés Monroy-Hernández, one of the researchers.
The study has focused on the four cities most affected by drug violence: Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz and Saltillo.
The researchers looked for common traits among tweets, hashtags and the Twitter users who were sharing this information.
The majority of tweets referred to a location, one of the cities and the word "shooting."
The tweets acted as a "public service announcement" that warned citizens to stay clear of certain neighborhoods.
The "curators" are defined by a large number of tweets and followers.
They are people who find and share information.
“The study shows that 61% of Mexicans use social media, but only 20% use Twitter.
About 4.2% of the online population in Mexico has written something against drugs or the drug trade on Twitter, ” added Monroy- Hernández.
Violence in Mexico has increased as a result of the war on drugs, and the media has become one of its targets, which has caused some of the country's media outlets to become much more cautious about reporting on these topics.
Because of this, the “curators ” have become necessary sources of information.
The researchers tried to interview some of these new “war correspondents, ” but many of them have remained anonymous in order to avoid the risks faced by traditional journalists.

The heavy rains that hit the province of Buenos Aires have left at least 35 people dead and thousands homeless.
The blog EA2CPG tells us about the climate phenomenon which hit Argentina on April 2, 2013, coinciding with the Veteran's Day and the Falklands War Memorial public holidays:
The city of Buenos Aires has around three million inhabitants.
More than 10% of the population has been directly affected by the recent rains, the most damaging in the last 107 years, according to the authorities.
In the early hours of Tuesday morning La Reina del Plata looked like Venice and will need several days to return to normal.
In the post "# Temporal: Relatos de la Catástrofe" ("Storm: Stories of the Catastrophe"), the Anfibia magazine, among images of the tragedy, also publishes some testimonies that victims published on Facebook, like that of musician Gabo Ferro:
In her house, my mum chooses among things she has kept for 79 years: what to throw out and what to dry and save. A neighbour, sad like a ghost because the water snatched a photo; the only thing she had left of her son.
These are not the first floods that the province of Buenos Aires has suffered.
Recurrent damage caused by the rains have prompted Argentine bloggers to debate whether minimal investment in infrastructure, fast-growing real estate, or climate change is to blame for the disaster. The Facebook page Cátedra Libre del Agua analizes the changes that Buenos Aires has seen since its founding:
Since its founding, the city has been growing and expanding towards the Buenos Aires conurbation. As this growth converges with streams that flow into the Río de la Plata, it channels them, the channel gets filled up and it's a lottery as to what happens next. Urban income is a temptation that is difficult to resist.

Meanwhile, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's government and the government of the city of Buenos Aires are also searching for culprits.
The national news agency Telam publishes declarations from Secretary of Federal Planning, Julio De Vido:
The Secretary of Federal Planning, Julio De Vido, claimed that "again the lack of management" of Mauricio Macri's government "leads us to regret fatalities and leaves 450,000 inhabitants without light" in the city.
On the other hand, Comunas 24.com reports that the chief of government of the city of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, declared:
“The residents of Belgrano told me that in some sectors some partial works we did contributed to somewhat mitigate the problem, but there has been a lot of damage and, obviously, what is missing is this final work at the Vega stream, that we have not yet been able to start due to the lack of national endorsement to take out a loan" "I think that the President should have seen what happened yesterday and everything that the people of that area suffered in their homes and businesses.
I hope a mandate is approved that allows us to take out this kind of loan. "
Macri recalled that it was more than four years ago that the City applied for those endorsements and made it clear that the loan, "will be paid for entirely by the City." Laura Yabrun (@ LambreLau) writes:

Madrid regional president Ignacio González voiced his support during a radio interview for establishing "certain limits" on the publication of compromising images in the media, saying that "you have to be careful of the damage to people and to institutions".
González, who was interviewed on Radio de Libertad Digital (Digital Freedom Radio) on April 4, 2013, made the claim for censorship only days after Spanish newspaper El País published a series of 20-year-old photos in which the regional president of Galicia, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, appears alongside notorious drug lord and current prison inmate Marcial Dorado.
Both González and Feijóo are members of the conservative ruling Popular Party (PP).
Spanish newspaper El Confidencial printed Feijóo's statement on the scandal:

The quest is on for solutions to poverty reduction with the approach of the 2015 deadline for the UN Millenium Development Goals (MDG).
Many organizations are exploring new avenues for answers hoping it can lead to fresh ideas.
Among the goals agreed to by the international community more than a decade ago was to halve the number of people suffering from hunger, and for the world's poorest citizens to gain productive employment.
Most of the targets are far from being met in most countries, but progress has been made, for instance in Sub Saharan Africa where the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day, poverty declined from 58% to 51% between 1990 and 2005.
Ideas exchange on the internet
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will hold their annual Global Forum on Development in Paris on April 4-5, 2013.
This year, the OECD is exploring more inclusive approaches to tackle the poverty issue by inviting to an open pre-forum discussion online with OECD scholars.
All the main conversation topics on the agenda are laid out for everyone to see and contribute.
Another interesting approach to online ideas exchange is hosted by Concerned African Scholars, an organization of scholars and students of Africa.
Among the many issues explored is the impact of the hundreds of billions of dollars flowing illicitly out of Africa on the slow progress of poverty reduction. The author, Janvier D. Nkurunziza, suggests one key to bringing down poverty would be "the repatriation of the resources which are currently held abroad and not benefiting the continent."
Had Africa had not lost so much resources in the form of illicit financial transfers, it is likely that poverty would have been less acute.
The logic is that keeping these resources in Africa would have produced higher rates of investment, allowing African countries to invest in productivity enhancing sectors such as infrastructure, creating jobs, and raising incomes, resulting in lower levels of poverty. This multistakeholder approach is also a key tenet of the open data movement, which is progressively penetrating the development sphere.
The Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform, a civil society organization-led public initiative, is an example of what open data could bring to the debate on poverty reduction:
Open development is where organisations are using information technologies, among other information sharing channels, to provide and share information.
Open development enhances transparency and accountability about resources that are available to be invested in development, how those resources are invested and what results they achieve.
In the end, all the stakeholders involved in this information sharing chain; the data owners and users benefit from this mutually reinforcing ecosystem
During the second and final day of the Caribbean Air Show, just a few minutes after it began, a T-35 Pillán aircraft, registration number FAD 1807, made in Chile and belonging to the Dominican Air Force (FAD), manned by First Lieutenant Pilot Rafael Eduardo Sánchez Astacio, and Second Lieutenant Pilot Carlos Manuel Guerrero Guerrero, experienced problems during an acrobatic stunt and fell to the sea.
The tragic accident took place on Sunday, April 7th, and was seen by thousands of Dominicans who had congregated on Santo Domingo's boardwalk to enjoy the pirouettes and feats of national and foreign pilots, drawing on the skies above the Dominican capital.
Less than two hours after the incident, the two lifeless bodies were found and brought to the Dominican Naval Base in Sans Soucí and from there transferred by helicopter to the Doctor Ramón de Lara Military Hospital, FAD.
According to the organizers, the 2013 Caribbean Air Show met all the international standards for shows of this nature established by the International Council of Air Shows, which supported the show.
The President, Danilo Medina, promptly expressed his condolences:
@ DaniloMedina: We deeply regret accidents like this.
Let us join in prayer for the family and friends of Carlos and Rafael.
Peace to their souls. Nevertheless, it did not take long for sectors of civil society to show its discontent. Raúl Raful, son of the representative to PARLACEN (Parlamento Centroamericano-Central American Parliament), Tony Raful, published on his Twitter account:
@ RaulRaful: That rescue team was a disaster.
Two divers without a tank were going to find those bodies along with small boats from Boca Chica? # ShowAereo
With the same tone lawyer Bartolomé Pujals said:
Some journalists and social network users affirmed that the plane was not suitable for doing aerial acrobatics, to which communicator and politician José Laluz responded: @ laluzjose: # ShowAereo The letter B on the registration of the Pillan means second generation and the technical data sheet INDICATES that they are good for stunts.
Now, according to declarations made to the Listín Diario, General Hugo González Borrel, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Dominican Air Force when the Pillán planes were acquired by the Dominican Republic, said that it is possible that there was a human error in the aircraft's fall, in which both pilots lost their lives.
Accordingly, the Dominican Air Force pointed out that they are carrying out on-site investigations in order to clarify what really happened.
Below are photos of the tragedy, taken with authorization from the news site Diario Libre.
During the Global Voices Summit en Nairobi, Kenya, I met some (relatively) new Global Voices collaborators.
One of them was Marianna Breytman, who translates posts from Spanish into English, making her an avid reader of the content published by the authors from Latin America and Spain at Global Voices in Spanish.
I spoke to her informally and you can see (and hear) her in the video below talking about Global Voices, translations and languages:
Since then we have been in contact via email, through which we spoke about the following:
Juan Arellano: You recently crossed the mark of 100 translated GV posts. Was this, in a way, a goal you set for yourself when you started?
Marianna Breytman: No.
The truth is that when I started with Global Voices, I didn't know where it would take me.
I was just doing the translations because it was something I liked doing. It was fun, as I mentioned to you in Nairobi.
But with each translation, I was learning more and more about the organization and its importance in the world of journalism. The goal of 100 posts came about when my 2nd anniversary with GV was approaching (in March 2013) and I wanted to translate 100 posts before then.
Well, my 2nd anniversary came on March 18 and a few days later, I translated my 100th post, so I almost made it!
JA: Have any of the translations that you have done for GV had an impact on you? Do you have any anecdotes about them?
MB: The translations that have an impact on me are the ones that take place in places I have been. I remember a post that Ariel had written about the "red devils" in Panamá right when I had taken my trip there.
I knew that I had to translate that post because I had just had that experience of seeing them all over the city.
There is another post I recall by Robert about the protests in Brooklyn following Kimani Gray's death.
I didn't even know that this was happening in my own city until I took on the translation.
When Elaine had been denied her visa to come to the U.S. (*), she published a post on her blog with her reaction to what had happened.
She wanted to spread the word and I told her immediately that I would translate it.
I was so sad upon reading her touching story and learning more about her situation, since she was my colleague and friend, that I was inspired to do the best translation I could.
That is why I love what I do.
JA: Since Spanish is not your mother tongue, how did you become interested in this language?
MB: Everyone asks me this and I still don't have a good answer! I have been studying Spanish for many, many years, since I was a little girl in elementary school, but I think that the first time I really became interested in it was when I was in the 6th grade and I had a Spanish teacher who was Orthodox Jewish from Panamá (that is that beauty of living in New York City!)
I think he had seen something in me that even I did not recognize and he encouraged me to continue learning the language.
Thanks to him, I began reading more, listening to more Spanish radio, and taking advanced classes. I think it was half that, half the simple fact that learning Spanish was something enjoyable for me.
But learning Spanish was never like that for me.
It was interesting and a lot of fun. I studied it because I didn't feel as though I was struggling to learn it.
I was simply doing something that I enjoyed.

JA: Given that you are a volunteer for GV, what other things do you do to occupy your time?
MB: Right now I work for a non-profit organization that has various student exchange programs. I work specifically for the Au Pair program, which gives students who live abroad the opportunity to come to the U.S. to take care of children and study at the same time.
My position is the International Recruitment Coordinator, so I review all of the candidates' applications and work with our international partners to help them promote the program in their home countries.
Aside from this, I occasionally teach Spanish classes in a center for collaborative education in Brooklyn.
JA: I read that you are interested in gastronomy... Do you cook in your free time?
MB: Where did you read that?!
Haha.. I am interested in gastronomy, but I don't cook as much as I would like. I love trying food from different countries.
I was in Panamá for the first time in March (and had the chance to visit another GV'er, the wonderful Ariel Moreno) and I had my first ceviche. It was delicious and I would love to learn how to make it. JA: You are quite young.
What plans do you have for the future?
MB: For now I would really like to continue working in the field of international education.
I am fascinated by this topic of blending and coexisting cultures, which is why I love living in New York.
For the future, I have thought about working at an organization that is dedicated to fighting for human rights and / or is involved in economic development projects.
I would also like to continue teaching Spanish classes.
And obviously I hope to continue working with Global Voices.
I would like to branch out and learn more about other projects within GV as well.
In fact, I recently did a few translations for Eddie in Rising Voices and that gave me the opportunity to learn more about that part of the organization.
I have also been volunteering with WITNESS (one of GV's partners that creates videos to fight for human rights) for over a year and I plan to continue helping them and doing translations for their initiatives.
In the following video we talk a bit more about Global Voices and the meeting that took us to Nairobi.
JA: Anything else to add?
MB: Yes, with the help of Firuzeh and Silvia, I hope to continue developing and growing as a translator.
The truth is that I never in my life thought that, being a volunteer translator, I would have the opportunity to become part of this GV family and meet so many incredible people who are changing the world.
It has honestly been a dream come true.

Journalist Jenan Moussa is back in Aleppo, Syria, tweeting her experiences as the war between pro- and anti-government forces intensifies.
Moussa's tweets are raw and personal, giving readers a snippet of what life is like for those caught in the crossfire.
Moussa, who is a roving reporter for Arabic Al Aan TV, Dubai, UAE, observes:
@ jenanmoussa: Its great to be back in # Aleppo & meet all my friends.
People adapted to war.
Dinner, in Aleppo, is accompanied by the sounds of mortars falling in the distance:
@ jenanmoussa: It's dinner time here in # Aleppo.
We are having Mexicana chicken as sound of mortars echoes at a distance.
After a night in the city, Moussa wonders:
@ jenanmoussa: Morning from # Aleppo.
I couldn't sleep till 6 am.
Everytime I closed my eyes I imagined bombs falling.
God, how do ppl stay sane?
In Aleppo, she visits the site where a Scud missile fell some 45 days earlier.
She tweets:
@ jenanmoussa: Earlier today I went to site where SCUD missile fell 45 days ago in # Aleppo.
6 bodies are still missing under rubble
Jenan Moussa in Aleppo, at the site where a Scud missile fell 45 days earlier. Photograph shared by @ jenanmoussa on Twitter
@ jenanmoussa: In # Aleppo I saw a father sitting on rubble, tears in his eyes. He's still looking for bodies of his 2 beautiful daughters & wife
@ jenanmoussa: While I was w / him, father found slippers of a child & handful of hair (woman's hair) under rubble. 'Maybe it's my wife' he told me
Despite the stressful situation, Moussa maintains her humour:
@ jenanmoussa: Activists here in # Aleppo laugh at me.
I am sometimes only one wearing my flak jacket in house.
They are used to the sounds of war.
And then goes to sleep without dinner:
@ jenanmoussa: We didn't have dinner tonight. Also no shower.
Not a necessity in a city like # Aleppo.
Good night you all.
Mehdi Khazali source: doostaranedrkhazali.blogspot.com
350 Iranian bloggers, political and civil society activists co-signed a letter last week warning that the life of publisher, physicist and blogger, Mehdi Khazali is in grave danger after he has been on hunger strike for more than 90 days.
But while some bloggers warn that Mehdi Khazali ’ s life is danger, there are also those who question whether he is really on hunger strike.
Khazali is the son of a leading right-wing cleric and former Counsel of Guardians member, Ayatollah Khazali.
He was arrested together with several participants of a writer's association called Saraye Ghalam.
Iranian blogger Freedomseeker explains the rumours:
... one of main reasons that people do not believe in Khazali ’ s hunger strike is that more than a year ago, it was announced that he had been on hunger strike for 67 days.
Shortly after he was released by order of Ayatholah Ali Khamenei, the Islamic Republic ’ s Leader, Khazali started his weekly mountain hiking and urged people to take part in parliamentary elections.
In the photos published from his mountain hiking, there was no visible sign of a long hunger strike and he appeared in good shape … His past activities with the regime made some people suspect the regime is in the process of creating fake opposition.
Not everyone shares this belief.
An online petition calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Mehdi Khazali:
Mehdi Khazali renews hunger strike.
Mehdi Khazali, a jailed Iranian physician and blogger, has begun his sixth round of a hunger strike in Evin Prison.
Mehdi Khazali was last arrested in November of 2012 after security forces attacked a writer ’ s gathering.
Kaleme reports that Khazali had broken his earlier strike when prison authorities promised to meet his demands.
However, a lack of commitment to those promises and the persistent “illegal treatment of prisoners by the interrogators and judiciary officials ” have led Khazali into another hunger strike.
Irane Azad writes that the same people who make fun of Mehdi Khazali ’ s hunger strike, if he dies tomorrow, will call him martyr.
These people boycotted the presidential election in 2009 but after the Green Movement erupted, they became supporters on the frontline.
Meanwhile, blogger 666Sabz warns, "People!
A person is dying in prison. "
Despite a tweet from President Ricardo Martinelli that incited controversy, everything is returning to normal after a few turbulent days between the Panamanian Football Federation and Baru Brewery.
On April 29, 2013, President Martinelli (@ rmartinelli) made a reference on his Twitter account to one of Baru Brewery's products:
@ rmartinelli: I respectfully ask Beer Panama to retract their demand from Fepafut ALREADY.
Their fight is against all of Panama and now it is with me.
The president's words sparked opinions both in favor and against his comment.
User Joanna (@ Buhenona) believed the tweet promoted irresponsibility:
Beer Panama, photo from Flickr user Erik Cleves Kristensen, under the Creative Commons License (CC BY 2.0) (@ Buhenona) @ rmartinelli what a lack of everything!
For Jesús Chucho Barrios (@ chucho507), however, it is a demonstration of love for the national team on behalf of the president: @ chucho507: @ rmartinelli Our President is definitely not a Robot, he expresses himself and feels just like any one of us. # ApoyoAlPresi @ la _ cascara
Baru Brewery lifted the embargo that it had against Fepafut the morning of April 30, as they informed Diario Pro:
At a press conference held on Tuesday morning, Baru Brewery manager, Helene Weesie, confirmed that they have notified the Panamanian Football Federation that the seizure which had been interposed on Thursday had been lifted and proceedings will resume after the 2014 World Cup.
The company also used the Twitter account for Panama Beer (@ Cerveza _ Panama), its main product, to make it known that despite retracting the seizure, they hope justice is done:
@ Cerveza _ Panama: Consumers want transparency and justice, as do we, which is why we will continue with the arbitration process after the World Cup.

Against a backdrop of growing concern about 'land grabs' in Africa and the conversion of smallholder agriculture to large-scale commercial agriculture, a leak from a controversial economic development plan has raised alarm in Mozambique, as well as Brazil and Japan, two key donors.
According to Mozambican NGO Justiça Ambiental and a number of other co-signing organizations, a leaked copy of the so-called Master Plan for the ProSAVANA program, dated March 2013, reveals the 'land grabbing' plans of the governments of Japan, Brazil and Mozambique.

Brazilian activist Fátima Mello explains what ProSAVANA is, and gives some important background on the project in an interview with Instituto Humanitas:
Prosavana is an aid and investment program between three governments: Brazil, Japan, and Mozambique.
It is an agricultural program that spans three provinces in the north of Mozambique, in an area estimated at 14.5 million hectares, where approximately 5.5 million people produce food as family farmers.
Prosavana derives from Prodecer, a program that was developed in the Brazilian "cerrado" (grasslands), in Mato Grosso, undertaken by Japanese aid with Brazil in the 1980s and that produced the characteristics that we know in the Cerrado: gigantic monocultures of soy on a large scale for export, intense use of agrotoxins, expulsion of traditional crops, concentration of land, contamination of the soil and creation of an economic powerhouse of land-owning elites and agribusiness, which translated into political power...
The land area in question in the "Nacala Corridor" is the size of Switzerland and Austria.
The agencies sponsoring this project and the government had not yet made maps available to farmers and citizens, detailing what land will be included.
Farmers organizations have felt totally shut out of the shaping of this project and policy.
The National Farmers Union of Mozambique (UNAC) said last year:
We, peasant farmers, condemn the way in which the ProSavana programme was drafted and the way it is intended to be implemented in Mozambique, which has been characterised by reduced transparency and the exclusion of civil society organisations throughout the process, especially peasant organisations.
On the blog Delegoa Bay, a blogger called ABM writes:
Conversing with family farmers along the Nacala Corridor it becomes clear that Brazilians and Japanese are going to communities to warn that ProSavana is coming.
Then they will maintain that they did so-called consultations with civil society.
What they are doing is not consulting.
In March, under increasing pressure the Mozambican government stated that "dialogue must be permanent".
Brazilian diplomats have responded to the calls for transparency by stating that small farmers will be included in the plans to develop Mozambique's Nacala Corridor.
Head of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency, Fernando Abreu, was quoted last month as saying that more information was needed, also claiming that there were no plans to resettle or move farmers from their land.
The leaks contain maps, showing which districts will be targeted for large-scale farming for export, allowing civil society organizations to verify exactly which communities could be affected in order to get a better idea of the potential impact.
The leaked document identifies seven "clusters" for intensive development.
Justiça Ambiental and co-signers describe what kind of agriculture the plan will bring
Some of the projects within the plan will provide large areas of land to investors.
According to the plan, 'the project has a high profitability and the internal rate of return was calculated at 20.3% and the payback is 9 years.'
They go on to question whether there are any benefits for the Mozambicans in the region:
It is telling that only one of the seven clusters in the Master Plan is aimed at small scale farmers and family food production.
And this cluster only proposes the same old failed green revolution model of development.
The Master Plan puts no real thought and energy into the needs and capacities of peasants in the Nacala Corridor.
Corporations are the big beneficiaries of this Master Plan.
They will get control over land and production and they will control the trade of the foods produced, which will be exported along the roads, rail lines and Nacala port that other foreign corporations will be paid to construct with public funds from Mozambique and Japan.
The National Farmer's Union foresaw a host of problems arising from the ProSAVANA project already last year.
Landlessness, social upheaval, impoverishment, corruption, water pollution and ecological imbalance due to deforestation, the Union warned, could become a reality if the project went ahead as planned.
"Good news Pamiris," writes Bektour Iskender, President of Kloop Media, a Kyrgyz news portal and blogging platform.
"Wikipedia has provided permission to begin a version of the site in Shughni."
Shughni is one of the main languages spoken in Gorno Badakhshan province (GBAO), a remote, eastern part of Tajikistan dominated by the Pamir Mountains.
Iskender helped local internet users file the request to create a Shughni section of Wikipedia following a new media training session in Khorog, the province's administrative capital, over two years ago.
"Now begins the small matter of realizing.
But I can't help there, since I don't know a word of the language, "he says.
Shughni is one of several dialects in the Pamiri language sub-grouping, a branch of the Farsi linguistic tree that also includes Tajikistan's state language, Tajik.
Tajik already has a growing Wikipedia presence, with 10,864 articles, more than Turkmen (4,765), but less than Kazakh and Kyrgyz, (both around 25,000) and far behind Uzbek (120,882).
Non-state languages spoken in post-Soviet Central Asia, such as Uyghur, fare less well (2,924), and the Shughni Wikipedia project faces an additionally daunting task since the proportion of the Pamiri community that can still write in the language is quite small.
Still, Shughni-speakers aiming to revive the language in its written form will be hoping that where there is a Wikipedia, there is a way.
Tension is growing in Bolivia as miners, teachers, health service workers and public university staff -all affiliated to the Central Workers Union (Central Obrera Boliviana, COB, in Spanish) - are on strike demanding an increase in their retirement pension scheme.
A number of strategic streets remain blockaded in La Paz and neighbouring El Alto, with limited public transport circulating their usual routes. Road blockades also impede the normal transit to other regions.
As protests escalate, on May 14 teachers and miners detonated dynamite in the streets of La Paz during demonstrations.

COB representatives demand an increase in their retirement pensions from the current 70 percent to 100 percent of the their salary.
They are asking that the increase of 30 to 50 percent in their compensation come from public funds saved in the Solidarity Fund (Fondo Solidario in Spanish).
Negotiations are intermittent as the Government requests COB representatives to suspend demonstrations and blockades.
Moreover, low-rank Police Unionists and their wives have threatened to join the general strike demanding better pension schemes, arguing the same conditions that Army officers enjoy: retirement with 100 percent of their contributions.
Clashes between police and demonstrators were reported via Twitter under the hashtag # ConflictosBo.
In spite of the conflictive climate, and although blockades and demonstrations continue, dialogue between Unionist and Government representatives is expected to resume.

Blogger and Analyst Raúl Prada comments on his blog Horizontes Nómadas (Nomad Horizons): The COB is mobilized for wage demands in defence of a dignified retirement, which is nothing but deferred salary, they are against monetarist methods of transferring Solidarity Fund responsibility to workers, while the state avoids providing support with an appropriate fund to provide a dignified retirement for everyone.
On the other hand, Minister of Economy Luis Arce stated that the government does contribute to the Solidarity Fund and "guarantees the payment of the 70 percent in regards to wages."
He added that the government's proposal ensures the sustainability of the Solidarity Fund for about 30 years and supports payments to current and future pensioners ".
According to Government radio station Patria Nueva, "the authority explained that COB representatives are pursuing a 'political decision' rather than a technical one in order to increase pensions, which is not possible because it would jeopardize the income of all pensioners".
In his blog Boris Bernal shares the analysis made by the Centre for the Study of Labour and Agrarian Development ("Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo Laboral y Agrario" in Spanish, or CEDLA): The current Pension System does not ensure a decent retirement income for workers to satisfy their basic needs when they become passive workers, and when physical strength as well as the labour market does not allow them to continue working.
Further down, the same analysis predicts harder conditions for young workers in the future: The scenario for young workers and for those who are contributing to the current system, and the one that was in force until 2010 (administered by the AFP system) is more critical, because unlike older contributors they will have a single source, their own contributions, that will make it even harder to reach the amount required to retire.
@ BahrainPA: Those sentenced to prison with the charges of insulting the king on Twitter are: lawyer Mahdi Al Basri, Mahmood Taresh, Mohsin Abdali, Hassan Abdali, Hassan Abdali and Ammar Makki.
Tweets that won't land you in trouble in Bahrain
The name Hassan Abdali appears twice and Global Voices Online cannot verfiy whether it is two separate people or a mistake.
A query by Global Voices remained unanswered at the time of writing this post. The association added: @ BahrainPA: BPA: consider these sentencing unfair provisions that violate the freedom of Expression
Meanwhile, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights says five Twitter usershave been sentenced to a year in prison - and calls for their immediate release:
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands:
the immediate release of those who were arrested due to freedom of opinion and expression and to drop all charges against them; put an end to the restrictions against social media in Bahrain; protect the free exchange of information on the Internet and not restrict it. The sentencing sparked criticism online.
Bahraini Freedom Prayers sees the sentences as a threat to silence other dissidents:
If the rest didn't shut up, next it will be 5yrs. # Bahrain
From Cambridge, the UK, author Toby Matthiesen tweets: @ TobyMatthiesen: Bahrain court jails 6 tweeters for a year for "insulting" the King. Another sign of GCC trying to limit Twitter impact
And researcher Marc Owen Jones challenges:
@ marcowenjones: They couldn't arrest everyone if they all insulted the King on Twitter. Or could they...? # Bahrain
Jorge Rafael Videla, Argentina's former president, died on May 17, 2013, at the age of 87 in a jail cell where he was imprisoned.
Videla ruled between 1976 and 1981, during Argentina's military dictatorship, a period marked by death that left thousands of people missing. In 1983 the former dictator was judged and condemned to life-prison for crimes against humanity.
In 2010 Videla was sentenced to life in prison for the torture and shooting of 31 political prisoners, and in 2012 he was sentenced to another 50 years in jail for the kidnapping of newborns during the dictatorship.
An obituary by BBC World says: "He was one of the most controversial and hated men in Argentina, under his regime close to 30,000 people died or disappeared according to human rights organizations." Jose Alejandro Godoy of website Desde el Tercer Piso (From the Third Floor) wrote about the events that took place during the years Videla ruled Argentina:
Systematic kidnapping of underage kids, tortures, use of the football world cup for propaganda (a few blocks away from the stadiums, there were torture centers), a badly executed economic adjustment, hundreds of Argentineans in exile, closing of unions.
The shameful legacy of a dictatorship that started with him and ended the day that some hallucinated Argentinean officer thought that starting a war in the Falklands was the best way to extend military rule.
And regarding Videla's death, he concluded:
Today, Videla died in a common jail without benefits.
He will be buried in a tomb unlike many of his victims who were thrown to the sea from an airplane.
Disowned by the Argentinean society.
He was judged in a historic trial that puts him in the darkest pages of Latin America.
On the other hand, LSO wrote a small entry in his blog where he refers to Videla as a "dignified official and soldier who fulfilled a mission that granted him honor."

Under the hashtag # MurioVidela thousands of Argentineans have reacted to the news, like user @ Cami-cotarelo:
@ Cami _ Cotarelo: There's no celebration for # MurioVidela, but today after almost 40 years more than 30,000 people rest in peace
Cecilia Saia (@ Cecisaia) also expressed the feelings shared by many Argentineans:
@ Cecisaia:: Today there's one less monster in the world. If there's something after death, may it give him back all he did a thousand times # muriovidela
Nobel Peace laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel (@ PrensaPEsquivel) wrote on his Twitter account:
@ PrensaPEsquivel: # MurióVidela, a man that has hurt the country and humanity deeply.
A cycle hasn't closed; we need to find more # verdad (truth) and # justicia (justicia).
Infobae published a Storify post with more reaction on Twitter.
A group of mothers on a hunger strike commemorated Mothers' Day outside the attorney general ’ s office in Mexico City demanding that the Mexican government keep its promise to search for their missing sons and daughters.
According to official reports, more than 26,000 people went missing in Mexico between December 1, 2006, and November 30, 2012, during the administration of former President Felipe Calderón.
The women have maintained the strike since May 9, 2013.
Erwin C. in The Latin Americanist blog quoted one of the mothers participating in the hunger strike:
“We will not leave until our cases have been resolved, the president meets with us and he gathers a working group to tell us when and how they will start to find our missing loved ones, ” declared hunger striker Margarita López.
López said her “disappeared ” daughter, Yahaira Guadalupe Bahena, was kidnapped two years ago by“ armed men ” and then tortured until she died.
López has urged authorities to uncover a mass grave where her daughter was allegedly buried in but her pleas have thus far been ignored.
López was one of the participants in a seven-day hunger strike that took place last November and that ended after Mexico City authorities met with the protesters.
Paris Martínez from the digital publication Animal Político has covered the hunger strike from the start.
In one post, he introduced readers to some of the mothers participating in the strike, like Nancy Rosete, whose son Elvis Axell Torres Rosete has been missing since December 29, 2010:
I decided to participate in the hunger strike because, as victims, we have no certainty about the authorities' actions.
It has been more than two years, and even though allegedly there are advances in the investigation, we cannot verify.
On May 13, Martínez reported for Animal Político that, "aside from a brief exchange of comments by deputy attorney general Ricardo Garcia Cervantes -on the day the protest began- no authority has come to ask about demands or to start a formal dialogue."
She says that they are feeling the effects form the lack of food, that temperature decreases at night, and that they don't feel safe.
Erica adds that citizens have been helping them.
Another protester affirms that they are not going anywhere: "We are not here for just one person, we are here for one common goal, which is the search of the missing":
In a country where the illiteracy rate of both sexes (15 years and above) is almost 40 per cent, education and the empowerment of the women and youth is an imperative necessity for any concrete development in Yemen.
Activist and researcher Atiaf Alwazir wrote a blog post entitled "Reading should be a right not a privilege" highlighting the importance of education for women.
She urged:
Let us all work together to demand concrete changes, and demand from the government to bring back the literacy program that it used to implement in the past.
We also must make the rights to education and health care as top political priorities in the national dialogue conference (which began on March 2013 and is scheduled to end in August 2013).

Activist and chairperson of the Rights and Freedoms Working Group in the National Dialogue, Arwa Othman stressed the importance of education but also added in a post on her Facebook page:
Not only is the right to education as stated by human rights conventions, but we must also include in the school curriculum in the Republic of Yemen (The New Yemen) these charters.. and they must be taught as a core subject to promote a human rights culture, tolerance, coexistence, peace, freedom, citizenship, equality, non-discrimination, freedom of difference, freedom of religion, etc...) i.e respecting the human being regardless of his / her color, sex, religion, language, political opinion and principles.. etc.
We hope to get out of this National Dialogue Conference a constitutional text which respects the right of future generations
China's media authority has announced new regulations barring news outlets and other organizations from reporting on foreign media coverage without permission.
The General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television's unveiled the tighter controls in a notice released on April 16, 2013, less than a day after The New York Times announced it had won a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper's report on the hidden wealth of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family.
In response to that October 2012 report, the Chinese government blocked the New York Times website as well as Wen Jiabao's name on Sina Weibo.
In addition to requiring Chinese media to have authorization to use foreign media content, the regulations also clamp down on organizations and journalists sharing information on social media, such as popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, that wouldn't normally be included in publication.
The notice, published by China's state media Xinhua, reads:
All news outlets are not allowed to use news information from foreign media or foreign websites without permission.
It is firmly forbidden for journalists and editors to use the Internet as a platform to seek illegal benefits; such behavior will be investigated and punished according to the law.
To start an official Weibo account, news agencies should first report to authorities for record and appoint a staff to be responsible for posting authoritative information and deleting harmful information in time.
Most of the stories from the foreign pages of state-run newspaper were sourced from international news agencies.
According to The Telegraph, the ban on the use of foreign media would have a big impact on Chinese newspapers.
The news has triggered online outrage among many Weibo users, especially among journalists.
Beijing-based journalist “Qingdeng Xiaxiangmingbian ” wrote:
Internet in China by Karen Roach via Shutterstock
Public opinion supervision is essential for a healthy society, the scale of criticism is the scale of democracy, "if criticism is not free, then praise is meaningless".
The correct conclusion is from a wide range of voices, rather than what is chosen by the authority.
Web user “Lida Suibi ” questioned if having such a tight grasp on the media is even effective in the long run:
What is harmful information?
I think there's only true and false information.
The purpose of the news is to broadcast the truth, which is the basic need of a society.
Most of the harmful information as defined by the propaganda department throughout the history of the Chinese republic proved to be accurate.
Blocking information and opinions may be effective temporarily, but such a policy of self-denial won't work in the long run.
Another web user "Yun Mu" echoed the sentiment with a Chinese idiom:
The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed.
"Ye Laodie aiLvse" wrote sarcastically:
Are we going to become North Korea?
Journalist Liu Xiangqian pointed out the lack of a new media law in China:
Laws and regulations are seriously lagging behind in the development of things!
The Internet has not been considered media in the legal sense, not to mention citizen media!
A YouTube video of three-year-old Luiz Antonio explaining to his mother why he does not want to eat octopus gnocchi for lunch has become the latest must-see worldwide.
The young Brazilian argues that he doesn't like to eat meat because "when we eat animals, they die," and that he likes to see the animals "on their feet, happy", and explains that we must "look after them, not eat them."
The original video in Portuguese, uploaded to YouTube on May 15, 2013, has reached nearly 1,500,000 views in only two weeks.
The English version was published on May 29 and has been seen over 900,000 times in only three days.
In a country where only a very small percentage of the population has opted for a vegetarian diet, the viral video has sparked a heated debate about vegetarianism on YouTube and Facebook.
Carlos Augusto Andrade explained the reasons:
The video has gone viral on Facebook yesterday, it is one of those you share with all sorts of people: your mother, your aunt, your hipster friends, contacts from school times... And although some groups on Facebook and YouTube have used the video to discuss vegetarianism, we understand that it has gone viral just for what is: a cute video of a child being curiously eloquent for his age and reflecting on something that not everyone among us bother to stop and reflect.
Luiz Antonio's philosophy: "When we eat animals they die.
I don't like it, I like them on their feet, happy.
We must look after them, not eat them. "
Inspired by the simplicity of the child's argument, some people have decided to adopt a meat-free lifestyle, such as many of the friends with whom blogger Viviane Zandonadi shared the video.
A food writer, she wondered about what she is going to do when her daughter starts to ask the same kind of questions:
I'm apprehensive.
When my turn comes, if Cata questions the logic of the food chain, I have no idea what I will say.
Luiz Antonio has overthrown my arguments.
At the end of the video, Luiz Antonio's mother, moved to tears, asks her son to eat just the rice and potatoes.
Writing for Acerto de Contas blog, Guilherme Carvalho hoped that other parents start to respect the sensitivity of their children, and stop resorting to lies or simplistic arguments to force kids to change their minds:
So, right in 2013, it is time we stopped deceiving our children and suppressing their feelings of compassion when they show no inclination to eat animals.
Let's respect and value this altruistic and compassionate stance.
Having a vegetarian child is not a problem, and today there is extensive literature showing the potential health benefits of this option.
Luiz Antonio's video has left many people moved - and hopeful.
What's in a name paired with a couple of numbers and letters?
A great deal, it turns out, when those letters and numbers refer to a strain of the influenza (flu) virus.
While it's not critical to be able to tell your hemagglutinin from your neuraminidase (the two proteins at the source of the "H" and "N" flu naming conventions), as the National Pork Board states in its influenza naming guidelines (PDF): "Knowing the proper name to call a flu virus is important to be factual and to avoid misinterpretation and improper response."
Case in point: last week's bird / swine flu mix-up, which saw officials in Trinidad and Tobago pointing fingers at Venezuela in the wake of (baseless) bird flu concerns following a visit by an official delegation led by Chinese president Xi Jinping; and officials in Haiti imposing a ban on the importation of meat and poultry products from their neighbour, the Dominican Republic.
The likely source of the mix-up, according to Canadian novelist and blogger Crawford Kilian, was a Chinese-to-English mistranslation by Xinhua, China's official press agency.
The first clue, spotted by Kilian on June 6, 2013 and reported in a blog post entitled "H7N9 in the Caribbean? Not likely", was a report in the Trinidad Express Kilian described as "the least likely story since the outbreak began."
The Express article centred on a "suspected" case of bird flu in Trinidad and Tobago, and reported that "questions were beginning to surface" as to why, given that "China is currently battling a bird flu pandemic ”, members of the 153-person delegation that accompanied Chinese president Xi Jinping on an official visit to Trinidad last week were not tested for bird flu on entering the country.
The article quoted Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Health as saying that while there was no "outbreak" of bird flu in the country, Trinidad and Tobago was in fact susceptible because of its proximity to Venezuela.
"Where to begin?" wrote a nonplussed Kilian. "The idea that senior members of the Chinese government might be carrying H7N9 is simply ludicrous, unless we assume that President Xi and his colleagues also moonlight as chicken merchants.
China is not "battling a bird flu pandemic."
The reported Chinese death and case numbers don't make sense.
And whatever they have a lot of cases of in Venezuela, it's not H7N9 or H5N1. "
Later that day Kilian reported having found the likely source of the misinformation: an article from China's official press agency, Xinhua, bearing the headline "Bird flu virus infects 724 people in Venezuela".
The Florida-based Haiti Observer blog carried a similar error in a June 7 post about the ban imposed by the Haitian government on the importation of poultry and other meat products from the neighboring Dominican Republic, where, according to the article, a warning had been issued "regarding the reappearance of avian flu (H1N1 virus) ” (emphasis added).
The error was reproduced in the Haiti's French-language daily, Le Nouvelliste.
The Dominican Republic exports a reported 25 million eggs and 8 million chickens to Haiti each year.
While there was in fact an outbreak of the H2N2 strain of avian flu in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Dominican officials have been adamant that the country is currently free of bird flu, stating that the country's five flu fatalities have been due to swine flu, which has no impact on the quality of local meat exports.

# 4M2013, the third Journalism and Social Media meetings organized by French CFI (Canal France International) were held from 12 to 14 June, 2013, in Montpellier, France.
Numerous experts from 35 countries in Asia, Africa, Caucasus, the Balkans and the Arab world debated around the theme: "How has digital development transformed the news?
Has there been any improvement in the quality of news provided? "
The conference was covered by eight young bloggers from Thailand, Egypt, Syria, Azerbaijan, Georgia and France.
You can find the complete coverage here, in French, English and Arabic, their coverage of the debates, as well as interviews and pictures.
More meetings are planned in 2013 in Nairobi (Kenya), in Georgia and, later, in Lebanon.
More than 64,000 people celebrated Inti Raymi, the Festival of the Sun, at Saksayhuaman archaeological park, about 15 minutes from the city of Cusco.
The staging of Inti Raymi started at the temple of Coricancha with greetings for the Sun, and then it continued at the Main Square.
It culminated in Saksaywaman with the ceremony itself.
Diverse ceremonies were then held, like the rite to the chicha de jora, the fire and the sank ’ u, the Andean people's main meal.

June 24 marks the Southern Hemisphere's winter solstice; the shortest day and the longest night of the year.
During the Inca era, the winter solstice marked the start of a new year, and according to 17-century writer and historian Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, it was the main celebration of the year.
In Cusco today, however, the date is more a show for tourists and also for locals, who consider the event a point of reference of their local conscience that stirs up enthusiasm and massive participation.
The website Toustodo's Blog explains the following about the solstice:
Astronomically, the solstice is the moment when the Sun reaches the highest declination North (23 ° 27 ’) or South (-23 ° 27 ’) in respect to the terrestrial equator.
In the Northern hemisphere the Sun reaches its zenith during the winter solstice at noon over the Tropic of Capricorn, which happens around June 20 or 21.
In the Southern hemisphere the Sun reaches its zenith at noon over the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 or 22.
Solstices are originated by the inclination of the Earth's axis over the level of its orbit.
The blog Medios Alternativos shares part of Inti Raymi's history:
After the conquest by the Spaniards, the ceremony was suppressed by the Catholic Church and the Andean community that used to celebrate the sun festival was split up.
Inti Raymi was then forgotten, until the mid 20th century when, as an expression of a great wave of revaluation of native culture in Peru, it was restored.
During the Inca era, Inti Raymi was a religious ceremony, now it is a theatrical representation, however, this expression generates a sense of identity in the people.
The version is expressed in its original language, quechua, with a corresponding translation to Spanish for a better understanding.
On Twitter there were also comments related to the Festival of the Sun, like this one by Kristell PerezAlbela (@ Kristellpa): @ Kristellpa: I wish I could be at the # IntiRaymi!!
@ SanBlasSpanish: Yesterday was Inti Raymi, hope you all enjoyed it! Meanwhile, Val (@ Vientino) shared the beginning of the celebration:
@ Vientino: From yesterday at dawn, the Festival of the Sun was celebrated, the Inti Raymi, at the plains and the highlands of the Andes.
Anyel (@ AnyelZae) referred to the preference some parents have when choosing their children's name:
@ AnyelZae: Gosh, sometimes parents are stressed when choosing a name for their children # intiraymi for example...
From Argentina, Ralph H (@ lopezraulh) shared how he celebrated the date:
@ lopezraulh: Yesterday at work we celebrated Inti Raymi.
With apacheta and an offering.
That's how particular we are. Lastly, ronaldchamat (@ ronaldchamat) tweeted about the excitement of having experienced Inti Raymi:
@ ronaldchamat: Five years ago I was at the # IntiRaymi, what a privilege having been there at that precise moment http: / / elcomercio.pe / actualidad / 159 …
Reham al-Hakami is a 13-year-old girl who got infected with HIV after being given a blood transfusion in a hospital in Jizan, in southern Saudi Arabia.
On Riyadh Bureau, blogger Ahmed Al Omran explains:
The case sparked wide outrage on social media sites, where many users demanded that the Minister of Health Abdullah al-Rabeeah resign from his position.
Al-Sharq newspaper reported that the minister has visited Reham at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center on Saturday and gave her an iPad as a gift, a gesture that was mocked by many on Twitter.
The storm of reactions, under the hashtag # الربيعة _ يهدي _ رهام _ ايباد which translates to "al-Rabeeah presents Reham with an iPad," is led by this tweet by Summer, which has been retweeted 1,715 times and counting:
@ Haifa _: And what happened if she dies?
Will he give her family an iMac?
@ olfatg: what's next?
A MacBook for a paralysis caused by a surgical errors # unbelievable
And @ 7iat _ 20 wonders why the girl was not flown for treatment abroad yet:
@ 7iat _ 20: The Health Ministry's budget is 86 billion (Saudi Riyals) and you just give her an iPad instead of sending her to a specialised hospital for treatment?
Bassam Altamimi notes:
@ BASSOOME: The Health Ministry's plan in the future is to give an iPad to all those who are victims of medical malpractice if they are alive and to their relatives if they are dead
While Suleiman Alosaimi projects new profits for Apple, the company which produces the iPad, saying:
@ bofares _ 55: The American markets predict a huge increase in profits from the sales of Apple products because of medical malpractice in Saudi Arabia
And Khaled Aldhaheri adds:
@ 5aled _ DH: I hope this is the spark that wakes up the nation from its slumber

A week ago today, on the evening of June 20, 2013, Brazil was shaken by the biggest wave of protests in the country's recent history.
In Rio de Janeiro, an event that began with a peaceful march from the downtown city to the mayor's office spread to other neighborhoods and ended in violent clashes between police and protesters.
According to official estimates, about 300,000 people attended the rally in Rio de Janeiro.
Among them, Brazilian photographer Calé recorded in photos the indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas by the military police on unarmed protesters.
The result are the testimony and photos below, handpicked by Calé for Global Voices Online:
At the beginning of the demonstration, people were dancing and partying on the way to the mayor's office, making it a joyful moment.

A violent group started a fight with supporters of a left wing party, but police took a long time to respond and didn't arrest anyone.

There were minor incidents, like a fight between supporters of a left wing party and youngsters who disagreed the march should be exploited or connected to any political party.

Curiously, the police took a long time to react and only sent 3 motorcycles to check it out, and probably report back. No arrests were made, even though some people were bleeding and pointing out the perpetrators of the attack.
Demonstrators made a human chain in front of the police to avoid skirmishes, and try to keep the protest peaceful.

When the crowd finally made it to the square in front of the mayor ’ s office, there was a heavy concentration of officers protecting the building, with the cavalry standing in front the gate.
Leaders of the demonstration made a human chain in front of the police to avoid skirmishes, to make sure a small group of bullies wouldn ’ t spoil such a nice evening.

The demonstrators were able to keep it peaceful in front of the mayor's office, until a 29 year old bodybuilder named Gabriel Campos, who is now wanted by the police, started to insult the officers on top of their horses, despite people asking him to get out of there.
At one point, demonstrators asked officers to arrest him before it was too late.
Demonstrators used wood panels as shields and threw stones at the police.

As there was no response, the demonstrators tried to take justice in their own hands, and a fight broke out.
It was just the excuse the police was waiting for.
At the first sight of misbehavior they started aiming tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd.

At no point was there an attempt to invade the mayor's office, the people simply became furious and started to fight back at the police with sticks and stones.
What happened next was the biggest case of police abuse of the decade: special troops including Choque and Bope swept the streets of downtown Rio clean, all the way to the bohemian neighborhood of Lapa, 2,5 km away.
In response, many stores and buildings were vandalized and robbed on Presidente Vargas Avenue.

Even after the riot was over they kept throwing tear gas at peaceful demonstrators on their way home, far away from the mayor's office.
There was no distinction between troublemakers and peaceful people trying to find their way back home.
As the subway stations were closed, everyone had to walk their way out of the conflict zone.

At Carioca station a group were waiting for the gates to open, when the police marched by Avenida Rio Branco.
This station is located in a pedestrian corridor, perpendicular to the avenue, and when the police was almost out of sight someone shouted "Cowards, son of a b...", and they immediately turned back and threw gas at the crowd.

Quickly the subway crew opened a small gate for people to get in, but ended up creating a trap were people got stuck in a funnel breathing gas.
Downstairs many were nauseous and laying down.

Many people who left the march at the fist sign of trouble decided to go to the Lapa neighborhood to have a beer, a distant and safe place in their heads.
But soon the squads were there too and they were trapped inside restaurants and bars as chaos reigned in the streets.
As people started shouting at the police, they irresponsibly threw tear gas inside buildings too.

Yes, there were vandals in the march who broke and burnt things, but most of these acts were confined to Presidente Vargas Avenue, closer to the mayor's office. So why did the police have such a large ray of action and pointed their guns at innocent people?
At gatherings and in social media, people now talk about their fear of joining new demonstrations, and some want it all to stop.
Only one expression comes to my mind to explain the behavior of our police force: state terrorism.

China has put into effect a new law this week requiring grown children to visit their parents “frequently ”.
It is strong tradition in China to respect the elderly and take care of parents as they get older, but modern lifestyles has meant that young people leave home for their own love and career.
The new law says adults should care about their parents "spiritual needs" and "never neglect elderly people", but it doesn't specify how often they need to visit the parents or what punishment they will receive if they fail to abide.
The law is designed as China's population ages rapidly due to the one-child policy.
The journal reported that more than 14 percent of China ’ s population, or 194 million people, are over 60 years old, according to the most recent figures from the National Bureau of Statistics. By 2030, that figure will double.
Moreover, since 2012, China ’ s pension system has been in crisis with a shortfall of 2.9 trillion US dollars.
Young Chinese are worried that they are being asked to support government retirees.
The new law has triggered ridicule on China's most popular microblogging website Sina Weibo, with many quipping that the enforcement of the law is questionable and visiting parents should be a moral issue to be encouraged rather than a law that should be enforced.
Some complained that they can't get enough time off from work to visit their parents even if they wanted to, while others thought that the law was introduced to make up for China's brewing pension issue.
Online personality “Zhuomo Xiansheng ” wrote sarcastically:
Photo from Sina Weibo
Family bonds should be based on spontaneous emotions.
It's funny to make it part of a law; it's like requiring couples to have a harmonious sex life after marriage.
Lawyer Yang Lei echoed the same sentiment:
The question is how to enforce the law? For example, give the parents a fingerprint attendance machine?
"Yu linfeng" speculated China's unfair social security is one of the reasons for introducing the law:
Social security is mostly for the civil servants, most ordinary people don't have any much pension to rely on.
TV host Cao Baoying thought that the law is a way for the government to avoid its own responsibility:
By introducing the law, emphasizing the one-sided civic duty, while weakening the government responsibilties.
An ifeng news commentary piece concluded:
Introducing the law to promote filial piety can be effective in forcing children to visit their parents, but if their external pressure can not be reduced, how meaningful is the helpless "filial piety"? How are we supposed to feel about the dignity of the law?
This post is part of our Special Coverage: Reformists on Trial in Saudi Arabia
Saudi judges continue to ban women from attending public trials, even when they are very close relatives.
Yesterday, the second session in the ongoing trial of Umar Al-Saeed, a member of the country's leading human rights organisation, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), was held in Saudi Arabian city of Buraydah.
The session was supposed to be held last Thursday, but it was postponed without a prior notice after several activists had traveled to attend it.
Al-Saeed, 23, was arrested on April 28th after refusing an interrogation without a lawyer.
Currently, seven members of ACPRA are imprisoned.
In yesterday's session, Al-Saeed responded to the charges and accused the interrogator of maltreatment:
I was interrogated with while being handcuffed.
The interrogator refused to remove the handcuffs and they were very tight and painful.
The interrogator also was provocative, calling me vulgar names including "you're a bull, you're a criminal" and others that I am not willing to repeat.

Furthermore, Al-Saeed, a senior university student who was about to graduate when he was arrested, said that the interrogator blackmailed him:
Interrogator Ahmed al-Thukri blackmailed me by threatening to deny me final exams if I did not confess to what he wanted.
Al-Saeed's wife and mother tried to attend the session, but the judge refused. In a previous trial, another judge said that "men are good enough," leading another ACPRA member, Abdulkareem al-Khadar, to refuse to attend the trial and he was arrested.

Several hundred residents in Jiangmen, a city near China ’ s southern Guangzhou, took to the street to protest against a planned uranium processing plant on July 12, 2013.
Marchers moved through the city carrying banners and wearing masks that read “we want children, not atoms. ”
The protesters say they're worried about radiation and possible nuclear pollution.
According to The New York Times, Jiangmen authorities have already signed an agreement with the China National Nuclear Corporation to house the six billion US dollar project. Construction is expected to begin at the end of this year. The local government announced the project last week, giving the public 10 days to submit comments.
The officials claimed that the plant is harmless, but the residents were not convinced.
A news conference was held after the protest, and the mayor promised to extend another 10 days for public comment.
Earlier this year, similar protest took place in China ’ s southern Kunming where residents protested against a gas refinery.
South China Morning Post has reported that the protest had been organized via China ’ s social messaging services: QQ and WeChat.
On China ’ s most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, information about the protests was quickly censored.
Some Weibo users were able to get around the censor and post pictures.
Below are some of the pictures of the protests from Sina Weibo:

Following teen activist Malala Yousafzai's speech at the UN demanding free education for all children, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan militant Adnan Rasheed, has written a letter to the 16-year-old Pakistani, urging her to return home and seek an education at a local madrassa.
In his letter, Rasheed says he wishes she had never been attacked and claims Malala was shot in the head by the Taliban because she is a propaganda tool used to malign the group, and not because she was pursuing an education.
His letter was passed on from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan media cell to journalists and was published in its entirety by Newsweek Pakistan.
Here is an excerpt:
I wish the compassion you learnt from Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) should be learnt by Pakistan Army so they could stop shedding of Muslim blood in FATA and Balochistan. I wish, the compassion you learnt from Prophet Jesus should be learnt by the U.S. and NATO so they should stop shedding blood of innocent Muslims across the world and I wish the same for followers of Buddha to stop killing of innocent unarmed Muslims in Burma, and Sri Lanka and wish the same for Indian Army to follow Gandhi jee and stop genocide in Kashmir.
At the end I advise you to come back home, adopt the Islamic and Pushtoon culture, join any female Islamic madrassah near your hometown, study and learn the book of Allah, use your pen for Islam and plight of Muslim ummah and reveal the conspiracy of tiny elite who want to enslave the whole humanity for their evil agendas in the name of new world order.
Rasheed tells Malala he feels compelled to write to her because they belong to the same Pushtoon tribe: "all my emotions were brotherly for you because we belong to same Yousafzai tribe."
Rasheed was broken out of jail in 2012 by the Taliban, where he was awaiting his death sentence for attempting to assassinate former president Pervez Musharraf in 2003.
He is a former member of the Pakistan Air Force. More Global Voices stories from Pakistan on Malala:

It looks like Pavel Durov can finally return to Russia without a prison sentence threatening from overhead.
That, for the moment anyway, seems to be true, now that St. Petersburg detectives have closed their inquiry into Durov's alleged involvement in an April 5, 2013, traffic accident that left one police officer with minor injuries. Despite finally establishing that it was indeed Durov driving the car, investigators today announced that they have been unable to find evidence that he acted with malicious intent.
Accordingly, they have reduced the criminal charges to a misdemeanor, and sent the case to a local police branch for a decision about the appropriate penalty.
Durov — "Russia's own Zuckerberg" and creator of the country's most popular online social network, Vkontakte — has been living outside Russia since the car incident, presumably to avoid investigators' summons to come in for questioning. Strangely (in light of today's news), police only two days ago extended by a full month their investigation into the hit-and-run case, which was due to expire for lack of charges.
Though they only considered Durov a witness before today, police have now gone ahead and elevated his status to perpetrator, albeit with the crucial diminution of the crime from "using force against a state representative" to "disobeying an officer of the law."
What prompted this about-face in investigators' behavior?
Did someone high in the government intervene to "call off the dogs"?
Or has Durov been dealing on the side, and could this end to his criminal case mean that he's struck a compromise with Kremlin authorities, who lately have demonstrated growing eagerness to exercise control over Vkontakte?
Durov and his spokespeople, for their part, have maintained his non-involvement in the April 5 traffic incident.
Durov denied the rumor and insisted that he had not expatriated. With the threat of prison removed, it now falls to Durov to return and prove that he has not left Russia for good.
This post, contributed by Elisa Moreno Gili, is the second part in a series on student revolts in Chile.
The original post, "Las revueltas de los estudiantes chilenos: Chile Movilizado (2ª parte)" was published in Periodismo Ciudadano.
As mentioned in our first segment on "Chile Movilizado" and student movements in Chile, the creation of digital media in this region is now a well-established practice.
In September of 2005, citizen journalists from Chile, Peru, and Mexico, among other countries, began to spark a desire among the Chilean populace for communication beyond the traditional means.
Inspired by the South Korean medium OhMyNews and driven by former senator Fernando Flores, the Atina Chile movement created El Morrocotudo.
This daily news site, still in operation, has had an impact on the creation of other local citizen media sites less influenced by the initial figure of the senator, as seen in the case of Maulee.
In large part, the philosophy of information sources in Chile regarding information management reflects the assimilation of citizen journalism into the population.
In PC's recent interview with Pablo Loyola, a co-founder of Chile Movilizado, he underscored the importance of viewing information horizontally, that is, available to everyone to be read and shared.
When traditional media sources reprint information originally published by Chile Movilizado, this must be seen as a positive outcome, a reinforcement of the work being carried out by the contributors.
When we see that a newspaper has used information from our page and published it as its own, we know that we're having a positive impact, so we continue doing what we're doing.
Chile Movilizado as a medium came about as the result of protests by Chilean students for reforms in the Ley General de Educación, or General Education Act.
A geotracking platform allows for the mapping of higher-education campuses that are currently being occupied by students.
From left to right: Juan Jose Peters, Pablo Loyola, and Aníbal Vivaceta, co-creators of Chile Movilizado
The protests, which Minister of Education Carolina Schmidt regards as “illegitimate", have resulted in several student injuries by police forces.
Pablo Loyola states that “the police or security forces in Chile have access to a great deal of information; the people who are not so well-informed are the citizens themselves. ” Therein lies the importance of creating citizen media like Chile Movilizado, which give the population access to updated information on a local level.
It's no secret that web-based social movements are playing a key role in the Chilean elections.
Members of the political elite, such as current presidential candidate Marcel Claude, take advantage of social networks (in Claude's case, with support from Twitter-based student organizations) to spread their messages.
A recent lecture presented by Claude at the Universidad del Mar was promoted on Chile Movilizado as a movement-sponsored event.
Chile Movilizado is working to attain complete coverage of student protests in the future. Its goal is to include information updated on a daily basis as well as coverage of both past and future events in order to create a “handbook ” for demonstrators.
Peruvian blog Los mil rostros de la ciudad tells about an encounter its blogger had with writer Mario Vargas Llosa on a street in Miraflores, where many of Vargas Llosa's novels take place:
I met Mario Vargas Llosa when Populibros published his book The time of the hero, during a military government. So, that morning when he passed along the entrance of my building, greeting everybody with his usual courtesy, I felt the urge to ask him: “was it here? ”, as we always believed that where my building stands now was the precise location of the house where he lived in his youth.
But I didn't dare to.

Since August 19, Colombia has been experiencing an agrarian strike, through which farmers are demanding guarantees from the government that allow them to live with dignity in order to sow the land. In a country with high agricultural potential, opinions are abundant and it appears as though there is no negotiated solution in sight.
This has generated countless expressions of concern among citizens. Tatiana Mena (@ TatianaMenaV) says:
I must confess: I am upset about the country's situation and the situation that many people are living through, poverty, is even more upsetting...
Maria Fernanda Carrascal (@ MafeCarrascal) imagines different scenarios for Colombia, as she accompanies her post with an image:
What would Colombia be, what would we be, without our farmers. (Cartoon reads: "Sorry for the inconvenience, we are risking our lives so that you can have food on your table")
And Soñando Despierto (@ juanrhc) affirms:
Santos looking for peace with terrorist guerrillas and declaring war to those who feed us.
Image by Liliana Castro Morato on Facebook
In the midst of the conversation are also the voices of those calling for real action on the part of all those who continue posting their opinions via the Internet.
Maly Mejía (@ Maly) expresses the following:
(The farmer's situation is my situation) we are on twitter writing and not doing anything in real life, that is how we are. And Ricardo Casas (@ BecauseImHouses) says sarcastically:
The true farmers are those that fight on social networks for improvements on likes and increases in favs On the other hand, the blog El Churro shares photos from the fourth day of the strike and assures that:
The national and regional media have stigmatized up until now, detracting from the magnitude that the agrarian and popular strike has had. Concluding the fourth day of protests, the media reported shortages and curfew measures, meaning the conversation has not ceased under hashtags # LoQueEsConLosCampesinosEsConmigo (The farmer's situation is my situation) and # YoParoPor (I strike for).
Elysium, a movie set in the year 2155 starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, takes a stab at the health care system in the United States, but it also offers an insight into the country ’ s immigration system if comprehensive reform takes place — sort of.
The film, directed by Neill Blomkamp, takes place on a state-of-the-art space habitat called Elysium in an overpopulated and ravaged planet Earth.
Matt Damon in his leading role on "Elysium." Photo taken from YouTube.
Elysium centers its focus on a former convict named Max (Damon), whose deplorable health condition forces him to seek the services of a criminal political leader who also wants to get a hold of Elysium ’ s exceptional health care resources in order to find a cure for ailing earth inhabitants.
Nevertheless, they will face Elysium ’ s rogue Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Foster), who relentlessly keeps inhabitants (or as the movie calls them, “illegals ”) from entering Elysium at all costs.
At the beginning of the movie, a space ship carries a large number of immigrants in an attempt to enter Elysium, to which Delacourt orders a merciless takedown.
Albeit not in the same fashion, law enforcement has been an important component in the passage of S.744 bill on June 27, 2013, so as to halt immigration influx at the border.
As Elysium unravels, one would think that the main reason these “illegals ” want to flee planet Earth for a more comfortable life in Elysium is paralleled to the reason why many immigrants decide to cross the border and find a better life in the United States (of course, the U.S. being the“ Elysium ” for all hopeful immigrants overseas).
The movie also shows that immigrants go to Elysium to find better health care, but they need to become Elysium citizens in order to enjoy it.
In real life, many undocumented immigrants face the same problem, as they don ’ t have access to health care.
Before entering into the weeds of immigration discussion, blogs such as ThinkProgress explain that Elysium falls short in explaining why health care in the spatial satellite is better than on Earth:
“But Elysium falls apart the more you think about it – and fails in its mission to speak truth to power – because of its inability to explain a simple question: why is health care scarce on Earth in the world of Elysium?
The movie shows us many ways that life in Elysium is more comfortable and satisfying than life on earth, but Blomkamp focuses his camera narrowly on people on Earth who want to get to Elysium mainly for access to medical pods that can cure even grave illnesses with a single, quick scan. ”
ThinkProgress goes on to say:
“And at the conclusion of the movie, they get it.
After Spider and Max download a program into the Elysium mainframe that makes everyone on Earth a citizen, and thus able to be scanned by the devices, shuttles full of the pods take off for Earth where people of all races, genders, and creeds flock to make use of them.
It ’ s not as if there ’ s a medical device scarcity.
There could be other reasons that health care is restricted, but it ’ s not particularly made clear in the movie what those motives might be. ”
Applying the latter paragraph to real life, one can imply that legalizing the immigration status of 11 million people in the United States will ensure a better quality of life for them.
As the Immigration Policy Center points out:
Including legal immigrants in the health care system not only strengthens the system, but is a critical part of their integration into U.S. society.
In addition to working, paying taxes, and learning English, legal immigrants should be able to pay their fair share and have affordable health care like everyone else.
When asked whether the film depicts what human conditions will be like in 140 years, Blomkamp answered: “No, no, no.
This isn't science fiction.
This is today.
This is now. "
In terms of immigration, Blomkamp may not be that far from the truth.
Elysium paints the United States as a country that has been overtaken by Latinos and whose de jure language is Spanish, when signs in local offices and factories contain larger Spanish-written signs and law enforcement referred to as “Policía. ”
Lastly, one thing we can also draw from the movie is that no society, as perfect as it intends to be, can turn a blind eye on its inhabitants and their needs -and approaching the case of immigration is the first step towards understanding human stories.
Peruvian athletes Raúl Pacheco and Gladys Tejeda won their respective categories in the Mexico City Marathon.
Pacheco won the male category, crossing the finish line with a time of 2: 16,53 hours.
Meanwhile, the 2: 37,32 time achieved by Tejeda gave her the first place in the female category.
Peruvian sports newspaper Depor.pe (@ deporpe) announced the news on Twitter:

As Liberia marks the 10th anniversary of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the 14-year civil war, nearly 25,000 school-leavers failed this year's admission test to the University of Liberia. It is the first
time that not a single candidate passed the admission test.
Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel peace laureate, acknowledges that the education system in Liberia is "in a mess".
Public Domain photo from the US State Department.
The BBC has reported that Liberia's Education Minister Education Minister, Etmonia David-Tarpeh, found it hard to believe that not a single candidate passed.
She therefore intends to meet university officials to discuss the matter.
She describes the failure rate as "mass murder."
However, a private consultant, James Dorbor Jallah, who was hired by the university to manage the entrance examination confirmed the report and said the days are over when students were admitted into the University of Liberia through bribery or based on how many important people they know.
The world has reacted on Twitter with shock and disbelief at the news.

Massive protests, the biggest since President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III took office three years ago, rocked the Philippines on National Heroes Day as hundreds of thousands expressed indignation against government corruption and called for the full abolition of the pork barrel.
Police estimated that around 80,000 to 100,000 gathered in Rizal Park in Manila, the national capital, while thousands more held mass actions in other cities nationwide.
Public outrage against the corruption-tainted pork barrel came in the wake of exposés on the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which is allotted for legislators in Congress and Senate for use in pet projects.
The PDAF has long been the target of critics as a site of official corruption.
But public uproar swelled after a whistleblower identified businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles who is alleged to have conspired with lawmakers to pocket P10 billion through the fund.

From @ muntingprinsipe
Dubbed the “Million People March, ” the idea behind Monday's predominantly middle-class gathering in Rizal Park originated from social media interactions between concerned netizens on Facebook and Twitter.
The concept for a million people march against the pork barrel began with a random Facebook post by music producer Ito Rapadas.
What we need is a MILLION PEOPLE MARCH by struggling Filipino taxpayers- a day of protest by the silent majority that would demand all politicians and govt. officials (whatever the political stripes, color they may carry) to stop pocketing our taxes borne out from our hard work by means of these pork barrel scams and other creative criminal acts.
This was shared by various netizens including his friend Peachy Bretaña who suggested that the mass action be held on August 26 in time for the National Heroes Day.
Protest actions were also held in various cities nationwide, notably in Bacolod City, Baguio City, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu City, Dagupan City, Davao City, Digos City, Dumaguete City, Iloilo City, Naga City, and Puerto Princessa in Palawan.

Apparently, many were not convinced.
Here were some reactions on Twitter:
You don't decide where we want our money to go.
WE DO.
We want our money for national development, welfare and security. # AbolishPork — Joseph Benjamin Seña (@ MonsterICEMAN) August 27, 2013
If Noynoy and protesters on the same side, why did people still go out despite his presscon last week?
Abolish vs renaming.
Meanwhile, Pixel Offensive said that if the President is truly on the people's side against pork barrel it should manifest on the following:
1) Abolition of all pork, no exemption.
Kulangot lang ito kumpara sa PORK nya.
2) His staff wouldn't post anti-rally tweets.
This just exposes the Presidential inner circle's way of thinking Let's raise this discussion a bit higher, shall we?
Do you expect an haciendero president to serve the people?
Critics alleged that the “presidential pork barrel ” consisting of lump-sum allocations the disbursement of which is left to the sole discretion of the president and his executive department is worth more than 1.3 trillion pesos.
Hours before the anti-corruption rally, presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte tweeted a link of an article that described indignation over the pork barrel as a "nice but misplaced statement."
The article said that while the pork barrel has been abused it isn't necessarily evil and concluded by calling those joining the protest action as afflicted by a “hypocrisy of indignation ”:
Are we thinking the next step after, or like Juan Tamad waiting for someone to solve the problem for us?
Anger is the path to the dark side, and this is why the hypocrisy of indignation must stop, and why we must shift gears and solve the problem of how government spends our monies.
Another presidential spokesperson, Edwin Lacierda, also tweeted a link of the same article and quipped, "Who says blogging is passé!"
For his part, Communications undersecretary Manuel Quezon III asked the Catholic Church, which encouraged the people to attend the mass action, why it remained quiet during the incumbency of former President Gloria Arroyo.
The said officials have denied tweeting against the rally.
But in the end, no amount of public relations magic can suppress public outrage over the massive plunder of people's money by government officials and their cronies while millions of Filipinos suffer from hunger, joblessness, and extreme poverty.
Tropical storm Maring (international name Trami) caused record high floods in Metro Manila and nearby provinces in the Philippines which left 8 people dead, 41 injured, and 4 missing.
According to a government report, 125,348 families (602,442 persons) were affected by the storm.
As of August 20 in the evening, 40,837 persons are still sheltered in 198 evacuation centers.
About 415 areas in 68 municipalities / cities recorded flood cases.
A total of 162 flights (59 international and 103 domestic) have been cancelled due to the storm.
Filipinos used the hashtag # maringPH and # floodPH to monitor the flood situation in Manila and nearby regions. Below are some photos on Twitter and Facebook which show the extent of the flooding disaster.

David Oliveira de Souza, a doctor and professor from the Research Institute of the Sirio-Libanés Hospital, sent an open letter to the more than four hundred Cuban doctors who recently arrived in Brazil and who constitute the first group of a total of 4,000 physicians who are expected to come to this country before December of this year.

Welcome, Cuban doctors.
You will be very important for Brazil. The lack of doctors in remote and outlying areas have left our people in a difficult situation. Do not worry about hostility from some of our colleagues.
You will be compensated greatly by the warm welcome in the communities for which you will care from this point on.
According to Oliveira de Souza, in states like Sergipe, it is easy to move from the capital to the Interior, but even so there are hundreds of unused job positions, even in equipped health units and in good conditions.
Before the deficit of 14,500 physicians in the South American nation, the government of Dilma Rousseff approved the "Mais Medicos" (More Doctors) program, which will contract doctors from Spain, Portugal, and Cuba, among other nations.
Recently, one of the principle critiques on the contracting of Cubans states that "they were being exploited." In the face of this argument, Oliveira de Souza says in his letter: It was talked about as if they would work like slaves.
The Panamerican Health Organization (PHO), with a century of experience, would be an accomplice, since it signed the cooperation agreement with the government of Brazil.
Their smiling faces in the airports condemn those hypotheses.
In the name of our village and the majority of our doctors, I can only say with conviction: a brotherly hug and thank you very much.
Michael Parmly, ex-representative of the United States in Cuba, suggested to President Barack Obama that the Guantánamo military base be returned to the island's authorities, along with other recommendations mentioned in a 26 page report which the news agency Reuters had access to and which will be published shortly at the Fletcher Forum of World Affairs.

The negotiation of an agreement with Cuban President Raúl Castro about the naval base could contribute to the establishment of a direct relationship with the Cuban government and with Cuban citizens, thinks Parmly, who was Chief of Mission of the United States Interests Section in Havana between 2005 and 2008.
Most of the prisoners at Guantánamo could be moved to jails on United States soil, while the most problematic cases would stay on the island, notes Parmly.
According to the diplomat, the naval base is a "historic anomaly": The current partisan tensions on the (Capitol) Hill ensure that it would be an uphill climb, but it is the thesis of this paper that a similar bold step, akin to the Panama Canal, is called for regarding Guantánamo.
Colombians have planned a national "cacerolazo" for 6 p.m. Colombian time today, September 4, 2013. A cacerolazo is a form of popular protest in which people express their agreement with an issue by making noise and banging pots (cacerolas), pans and kitchen utensils, or other items that can be used to create sound.
Using the Twitter hashtag # CacerolazoPor users express their reasons to take to the streets.
Paola Ochoa Rivera invites the protest to move from the virtual to the physical:
# CacerolazoPor more protests in the street and fewer on Twitter
Tefy expresses her hope for a more fair nation: # CacerolazoPor a more just country
Meanwhile, Tatu García discusses the dignity of Colombian society:
# CacerolazoPor the dignity of my society Santiago mentions his disagreement with the national government's efforts and strategies:
# CacerolazoPor Santos's bad government and for kneeling in front of the empire and multinationals
And Stephanie states that participation in the "cacerolazo" is an act of solidarity with the nation's farmers, who have been on strike since August 19:
It is time to act in solidarity with the farmers and their justified struggles, get away from the screens and into reality LONG LIVE THE AGRARIAN STRIKE
For Camila Andrea, the protest serves as a call to work toward a better country:
# CacerolazoPor To have a better country for everyone and people in the future!! And in Catalina Gualdron's opinion, the protest is justified by the complex reality of life in Colombia:
# CacerolazoPor A country filled with terrible services, in health, education, agriculture... # YaEsHora It's time for a change!
However, Juan Sebastián believes that many people simply tweet about the cacerolazo to get favorites for their tweets:
# CacerolazoPor Lack of Favorites (?).
Finally, the Fuerza Común account shares this poster:
# CacerolazoPor the streets, through side walks.

Stay tuned for further posts about Colombia's agricultural strike, which has already been in effect for 17 days.
Two weeks ago, more than 90 people died when a passenger ship sank off the coast of Philippine province Cebu after it collided with a cargo ship.
But the impact of the collision is still being felt today after 120,000 liters of oil from the sunken ship spilled into the shorelines of the coastal towns of Talisay, Cordova, and Lapu-Lapu.
Aside from affecting more than 300 hectares of mangroves, the oil spill also displaced more than 3,000 fisherfolk and threatened to undermine the tourism business in the area.
Lizzy Oi visited a fishing village in Cordova and shared what she witnessed:
This is the face of Cordova today after the oil spill killed the livelihood of thousands of fishermen in the Municipality.
80% of its population depends mainly on fishing for their daily needs and now when everything was vanished by the devastating man-made tragedy, they seem to lose hope knowing that this problem will last for many months and even years.

Oil spill also reached Mactan beaches.

meylou also sympathized with the affected residents:
This is truly tragic.
My condolences to the families who lost their loved ones.
Pity for the barangays who were affected, fishermen who cannot go out to go fishing, dead mangrove critters. It will take years for the mangroves to recover, but clean up will need to be done diligently or the mangroves will perish: - (.
Thank you to all the volunteers
Clean-up operations were immediately undertaken by residents.
Lots of people invented interesting ways to help contain the oil spill: for example, local salons sent human hair, and business owners of coconut distribution centers sent heaps of coconut husk to act as absorbants.
They even thought of using saw dust to absorb the oil, but when you threw it into the water, the wind would just blow it away.
Hair donations and free haircuts were initiated to help in the clean-up drive.
Concerned citizens also collected chicken feathers.
In other relevant news... wanted to get a haircut to donate my hair to the oil spill in Cebu last weekend.

A stork accused of being a duck and framed for espionage and arrested in Egypt has ended up as a meal for an Egyptian family.
On August 31, news broke that Egypt had arrested a spy duck, with a suspicious gadget attached to its feathers.
Later, it emerged that the duck was a stork, which was named Menes, and that the tracking device on it was for a study.
On September 4, Mostafa Hussein announced that the "wrongly accused stork is free":

The euphoria was short-lived.
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia now reports:
I do not know if it is fate or what, but it seems that the story of Menes in the land of the Nile is extremely sad story.
After it was accused of espionage and spent a day in Egyptian detention, he was released in to a protectorate to fly free only to meet its end!!
He was hunted down and eaten by an Egyptian Nubian family in the south!!!
On Facebook, the Nature Conservation Society of Egypt added:
Sad news: Menes the White Stork has been killed. After being safely released into the Salugah & Ghazal protected area several days ago, Menes flew off to a nearby Nile Island, where he was captured and killed, to be eaten by local villagers.
The post explains:
However, the short-lived success story of getting Menes released, was not enough to keep him safe till he exited Egypt.
And the issue is bigger - and more complicated:
Egypt has long suffered from issues of uncontrolled hunting.
The post concludes:
The entire region has a very long way to go, specially in the field of raising awareness on hunting and migratory birds.
As the United States and Russia spar over the way ahead in Syria, the governments in Central Asia are following the situation closely, writes Nathan Barrick on Registan.net:
Russia chooses to focus on the perspective that the Syrian government is fighting a battle against Islamic extremists and this message likely resonates with Central Asian governments.
Official silence from Central Asia on Syria should not disguise the real sympathy with Russia ’ s perspective...... Central Asia is watching too … not because they will seek to develop and acquire chemical weapons to use against their populations, but to note how much confidence they can place in a security partnership with the United States, or even if they should re-evaluate and partner more closely with Russia.

Venezuela is sitting on top of the largest oil reserves in the world and has a continual flow of dollars coming in.
So they are not on the brink of a collapse. But they are progressively sliding into the swamp of serious economic dysfunction that will make sustained growth difficult and that could undermine Chavismo as a viable democratic political project.
David Smilde writes about Nicolás Maduro's first six months in office in the blog Venezuelan Politics and Human Rights.
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her allies lost by large margins in the biggest and most important elections in the country yesterday.
Her legislative lists were crushed in Buenos Aires (both city and state), Cordoba, Mendoza, and Santa Fe.
There is a reason that every major newspaper is talking about her defeat and even the pro-Kirchner media is relatively subdued in its spin. The voting showed a clear rejection of the president and a serious drop from her big 2011 election win. Bloggings by boz lists five points on the legislative elections held in Argentina on October 27, 2013.
On 14 September, Tunisian artists Hamzaoui Med Amine and Kafon released their newest song 'Houmani'.
With more than 3.4 million views on YouTube so far, the song has become an anthem for Tunisian Youth.
The video clip which only cost 250 dinars (around 150 USD) to produce, depicts residents of a disadvantaged neighborhood as they go through their daily lives.
In the Tunisian dialect, the adjective Houmani derives from the noun Houma, which could be translated to a 'working-class district'.
Houmani refers to someone living in a working class area.
A working class area in Tunisia is called Houma... And rap speaks about these districts inhabited by the poor class, which officials and famous personalities rarely talk about
An Alien listening to Houmani.
In the song, Hamzaoui and Kafon describe how life is like for youth living in working-class neighborhoods in Tunisia.
The song lyrics say:
We are living like trash in a garbage can... is suffocating here
Blogger Mehdi Lamloum explains howHoumani has been successful:
Houmani, a simple song with a strange title and a video clip that did not cost much, has generated big debates these recent weeks.The song has quickly blended into the popular culture generating several conversations and debates... The issue of working class neighborhoods vs rich neighborhoods, though not directly tackled in the song, is very present.
A question has been raised regarding this: who has the right to listen to Houmani?
Do residents of ‘ rich neighborhoods ’ have the right to identify themselves with the everyday life recounted by Houmani?
He adds:
Those who criticize the song from a musical perspective are totally right.
But, they need to see what is beyond the piece: the work has succeeded in transcribing part of what Tunisians feel, whether they come from poor districts or not and whether they are living the everyday life described in the song or not...

Aid is not being properly and quickly delivered to communities which survived super typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in the Philippines.
Many survivors are complaining that the promised relief packs by the government have not yet reached them.
Haiyan hit the Visayas islands last Friday triggering a storm surge that killed more than 1,500 people.
But the casualties could be higher since the situation in remote coastal towns is not yet revealed.
Because of damaged roads, rescuers and relief groups could not access these communities.
Desperate for food, some survivors ransacked supermarkets and rice warehouses.
Looting was reported in Tacloban City and several towns of Leyte province.
In response, the government promised to expedite the distribution of relief goods as it deploys more police forces to restore order in the typhoon-ravaged communities.
Meanwhile, panic buying ensues in Samar:

Through the Facebook page of Randy Felix Malayao, a survivor asks the public not to be harsh in judging the looters:
Dont be so quick to judge looters, i was looter.
I looted medIcine for the red cross, milk and food for the children.
Walked 4 hours and dug into 2 foot empty plastic bottles to get at least something to drink and bring back some.
The people who took flat screen tv's were the same people who offered to give me a drink and some lugaw (rice porridge).
Those who looked like ex-convicts offered me something to eat.
Almost all the time they are willing to lend a hand when you said you really need something.
What they didnt show on the news was how people were helping each other amidst the catastrophe.
Don ’ t call them looters, writes Martha Villarosa:
Looters?!
No one has the right to call them with such a title.
Just imagine how painful it is as many of them lost their houses, loved ones passed away, nothing to eat nor drink.
Just be thankful coz we're alive, safe and still enjoying our lives.
Let's all be positive on this.
All our fellow countrymen need is our support and prayers to help them get through this.

The country ’ s top education official, Brother Armin Luistro, issues this message to educators:
Let ’ s look for people first.
Don ’ t worry about damages to property — we will deal with that later.
The worst thing is to count buildings and fallen trees and not account for our people.
Second, let ’ s bring our children back to school.
The best way for kids to recover is to bring them back to their routine as soon as possible — and that is to bring them to school.
There is no need to conduct classes right away.
Let them play.
Do activities.
Atom Araullo reports that communication signals have been partially restored in Tacloban:
Safe in Tacloban!
Devastation is overwhelming.
More and more Filipinos are participating in relief operations:

Frank Cimatu reminds and warns us about the meaning of resilience:
You know what resilience really means?
It would be a month or two from now when everyone would have left, all the free food stopped coming, the people would be back to fending for themselves and the realization of what happened and what's in store for them would hit them like a full force gale.
Then the people would know what resilience really means.
Michelle Bachelet votes on November 17, 2013 in Santiago, Chile.

With 46.7% of the vote, former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet was the clear winner of Chile's presidential election.
However, the former Executive Director of UN Women will have to face a runoff election in December against conservative candidate Evelyn Matthei, who came in second with 25% of the vote.
But on social networks users had voiced their discontent with Bachelet's candidacy and her previous administration throughout the campaign.
After yesterday's results, many are commenting about the difference between views on social networks and reality in Chile:
A tip for brands: After these election results you know that social networks have NO weight.
I'm glad to know that social networks don't represent reality.
We are a group of privileged people with a smartphone. you probably don't have Twitter.
I would like to know how many of those using # SiVotastePorBachelet went out to vote.... You can't change the country on social networks!!
The hashtag # SiVotastePorBachelet began trending in Chile on election day, and has been trending today too, a day after the election.
don't complain about student protests.

Nelson Mandela was the first democratically elected president of South Africa.

Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa and a Noble Peace Prize laureate, died on December 5, 2013 aged 95.
Mandela spent 27 years in jail for his struggle against South Africa's system of racial segregation known as apartheid. Freed from prison in 1990, he became president four years later, and left office after serving only one term, a rare gesture in African politics. The internationally beloved statesman had an impressive way with words.
One of his most famous quotes comes from a defiant speech he made in court during his Rivonia treason trial in 1964, in which he said:
I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.
But, if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
Apart from his Rivonia trial speech, Mandela leaves behind many memorable and wise quotes made throughout his life.
Despite his passing, he continues to speak to the world through Twitter users, who have reacted to news of his death by sharing his words.

Police in Reykjavik, Iceland.

This article and a radio report by Traci Tong for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on December 03, 2013 and is republished as part of a content sharing agreement.
It was an unprecedented headline in Iceland this week — a man shot to death by police.
"The nation was in shock.
This does not happen in our country, "said Thora Arnorsdottir, news editor at RUV, the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service.
She was referring to a 59-year old man who was shot by police on Monday.
The man, who started shooting at police when they entered his building, had a history of mental illness. It's the first time someone has been killed by armed police in Iceland since it became an independent republic in 1944.
Police don't even carry weapons, usually.
Violent crime in Iceland is almost non-existent.
"The nation does not want its police force to carry weapons because it's dangerous, it's threatening," Arnorsdottir says. "It's a part of the culture.
Guns are used to go hunting as a sport, but you never see a gun. "
In fact, Iceland isn't anti-gun. In terms of per-capita gun ownership, Iceland ranks 15th in the world.
Still, this incident was so rare that neighbors of the man shot were comparing the shooting to a scene from an American film. The Icelandic police department said officers involved will go through grief counseling. And the police department has already apologized to the family of the man who died — though not necessarily because they did anything wrong.
"I think it's respectful," Arnorsdottir says, "because no one wants to take another person's life."
There are still a number of questions to be answered, including why police didn't first try to negotiate with man before entering his building.
"A part of the great thing of living in this country is that you can enter parliament and the only thing they ask you to do is to turn off your cellphone, so you don't disturb the parliamentarians while they're talking.
We do not have armed guards following our prime minister or president. That's a part of the great thing of living in a peaceful society.
We do not want to change that. "
"Time Is Now" Immigration Reform Rally in Washington, DC (April 10, 2013).
By David Sachs / SEIU (CC BY-NC-SA) Is immigration reform just a dream?
Millions have emigrated to the US, for family, opportunity or in the pursuit of a better life.
Today, there are 40 million immigrants in the United States, of which an estimated 11 million, live and work without legal status.
Fear of deportation drives many to live in the shadows, making them vulnerable to violations of basic rights protected under US and international law.
In this week's GV Face, l talk to activists and experts about the movement for immigration reform, and discuss what the proposed reform could mean for the daily lives of millions of immigrants.
Activist Marisol Ramos talks to us about the various youth immigrant movements offline and online.
Alfonso González author of Reform Without Justice and editorial committee member of the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) questions whether guest worker programs can solve the deadlock over immigration.
Global Voices author Robert Valencia talks about the various times reform seemed within reach but then got sent to the back burner.

When South African leader Nelson Mandela was released from prison in the 90s, Spanish-Peruvian musician Miki Gonzáles wrote the song "Liberaron a Mandela". Peruvian Twitter users remembered the song when they learned about Mandela's passing: What a hit by Miki Gonzales when Mandela was released, back in the 90s.
I remembered the melody but not the lyrics.

In September, Uruguay adopted law 19.128, which designates the country's territorial waters as a "sanctuary for whales and dolphins."
The law applies not just to the territorial sea but also to the economic zone that is exclusive to Ururguay and prohibits the chasing, hunting, catching, fishing, or subjecting of cetaceans to any process by which they are transformed.
The law envisages penalties for those who do not comply.
Exceptions will be made for scientific and medical cases, providing they are approved by state authorities.
The law also takes into account cases of harassment, aggression, or any other mistreatment that could lead to the death of cetaceans.
The law was unanimously approved by the legislature and was promulgated on September 13 by President José Mujica.
The new legislation strengthens Uruguay's existing conservation policies, implemented by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP) and by the National Directorate of Aquatic Resources (DINARA).
The Director of DINARA, Daniel Gilardoni, declared to the government publication Presidencia that: “For our country the biggest threat is shipping, a good deal of the beaching is due to collisions between whales and ships. ”
The newly designated whale and dolphin sanctuary in Uruguayan waters will be economically beneficial, according to an article entitled "Uruguay sanctuary for whales and dolphins: Let the cetaceans come to me" on the blog Ballenas en Uruguay. The cybersphere lit up with favourable reactions to the passing of the law.
Social media reflected widespread approval to Uruguay's new status as a "sanctuary for whales and dolphins."
On the one hand we celebrate this wonderful news about the creation of a sanctuary for our whales and dolphins.... http: / / t.co / DTtyd0hXVQ

Chat is a Dirty Word in Iran?
Internet service providers in the Islamic Republic have blocked access to WeChat say reports on several news sites and blogs.
WeChat is an application that enables smartphone users to connect to online social networks.
While the Iranian president himself, and at least a couple of his ministers use different social media platforms themselves to communicate with followers, Iranian citizens are banned from access to sites like Facebook.
Iran Vatan Dust tweeted about the news:
Next thing will be that they try to filter people's thoughts.
Faaar Ranak tweeted:
It does not matter whether you use WeChat or not.
The main problem is that they are filtering it.
Iranian blogger, Gilboygreen writes:
Why did the Islamic Republic filtered WeChat?
Because they are scared when people talk to each other.
Today, possibly got filtered that symbolized dialogue.
What is the reason that people are not allowed to talk to each other?
The authorities should answer this question.
When a channel to dialogue, to exchange ideas and to communication is blocked, how do you expect people to solve the problems in society via dialogue?...
Do not fear the word "chat".
Chat is a simple, human act, accepted in different societies.
Another blogger, 1ironi writes:
According to non-written law, whatever product, including food, that comes to Iran from abroad for the first time is banned...
There are several examples of this kind of product becoming targets, such as eating tomatos, watching TV.
Several MPs increased pressure recently to ban WeChat, but we can still use it via psiphon.
Iran-man-massoud blogs with irony pointing a finger to Iran's new president:
The operation at the home of Villavicencio -authorised by National Court judge Jorge Blum- lasted until 3: 00 a.m. The district attorney ’ s office had been looking for information held on personal computers and cellphones, which were confiscated as part of an investigation into suspected espionage in relation to emails sent by high ranking government officials. The investigation also involves the assembly member Clever Jiménez, whose office at the National Assembly was also raided.
Verónica Potes ‏ (@ veropotes) stressed that justice was not a game:
The film maker Carlos Andrés Vera (@ Polificcion) considered the incident an abuse of power which will most likely be covered up by a media campaign against Villavicencio:
11.- All of this constitutes yet another abuse by the state which will be covered up with a vile campaign against Villavicencio in the mainstream media.
Diana Amores Moreno (@ Diana _ Amores) tweeted an ironic comment about the National Secretary for Communication (SECOM) regarding the raid:
Excellent!
The article speaks about the experiences of Fernando Villavicencio, his wife Verónica and his two young children and has been shared on numerous social networks.
Pablo Jaramillo Viteri published the following photo on his Twitter account:
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, posted on his Facebook account and on Twitter (@ MashiRafael) that there was a recording of the raid and that it would be made public in due course:
A few months ago, he hacked into accounts belonging to the President and other high ranking officials. Investigations were filed against Cléver Jiménez and his “adviser ”, Fernando …

San Sebastián Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The Festival began originally as a celebration in honor of Saint Sebastian, born in Narbonne, France and who, during the 3rd Century CE, was martyred for not renouncing the Christian faith.
In Catholic imagery, he is commonly represented as pierced by several arrows and tied to a tree.
In the 1950s, the tradition of celebrating the festivals in honor of Saint Sebastian began as a way of collecting funds for repairing the buildings of the church of San José in Old San Juan. After several years, the tradition was discontinued until 1970, when the archeologist, historian, and anthropologist Ricardo Alegría suggested to Rafaela Balladares, a resident of San Sebastián Street, that they resume the tradition.
This is how the Festival was born, and this year it celebrated its 44th edition.
Currently, the festival has lost much of its religious character, and has transformed more into a city festivity that attracts more than 300,000 people annually.
Here I ’ m sharing some of the photos that I took during my visit to this year's Festival:
This is Calle del Cristo (Christ Street), where many people pass on the way to San Sebastián Street.

These cabezudos were made by the theater collective Agua, Sol y Sereno (Water, Sun and Calm), who offered a presentation in the Plaza de la Barandilla.

Here's the good news: Throughout the years, Global Voices has brought you countless stories of human hope, bravery and creativity from all over the world.
And here's the bad: Like other news sites, we're often guilty of focusing on negatives and perhaps even of depressing you.
Do you look forward to reading Global Voices?
Or are you put off by the seemingly endless stream of stories of injustice and human suffering?
In 2014 we're planning on pursuing more solution driven journalism, and hopefully showing more light and humanity than darkness and despair.
This does not mean we will ignore the bad things, like violence or poverty.
But we do want to highlight more positive developments. In fact we ’ ve already started doing it, by posting stories about good news you never heard from Yemen, or millions of children in Bangladesh receiving free textbooks, or how Angolans use the internet to preserve their languages.
So many of our stories are centered on online social movements and citizens mobilizing to improve their societies.
We want to tell this news in a way that inspires hope, rather than falling back on the more negative framing of regular mainstream news media.
For starters, we've created a new Good News category on Global Voices.
At the end of December, we hosted a conversation on GV Face about this idea between our co-founder Ethan Zuckerman, our deputy editor, Sahar H. Ghazi, advocacy editor, Ellery Biddle, and myself.
It's going to be a long term effort to gradually change the way we tell stories together with our authors and editors. We're following the lead of many other websites and news organizations who are pioneering this type of reporting under the headings like positive news, solutions-driven journalism, constructive reporting, and similar.
Even the Huffington Post has a Good News section (though you'll probably find more cute pet stories there than you ever will on Global Voices).
The world we want you to experience on Global Voices is beautiful.
It's inhabited by brave and creative individuals who believe in making the world a better place.
Maybe we can even give our readers a sense that there's something they can do to help too. Take a look at our Good News and let us know what else you ’ d like to see on Global Voices.

She also discusses why the voices of South Sudanese journalists are not heard:

Glenda Umaña, a Costa Rican journalist who is covering today's presidential elections, comments on Facebook and Twitter:
As Berlin and Tokyo mark 20 years of friendship as sister cities, representatives of two creative industries, including Chairman of the Club Commission of Berlin Marc Wohlrabe and Takahiro Saito, a lawyer and member of Let's Dance, a consortium that fights against Japan's dance regulations, will come together for the AFTER 25 conference on March 1, 2014 in Tokyo to discuss how creative culture can contribute to the socio-economic development of both cities:
After the fall of the Berlin wall, extreme social, cultural and economic changes transformed the city into a unique playground.
Today, 25 years later, it attracts creatives, tech startups, social entrepreneurs, and investors from all over the world.
Berlin recognized its creative sub-cultures as part of its identity and history, which now act as key drivers for tourism and economy.
This transformed Berlin into a unique, successful city demonstrating how supporting creativity can grow into key economic and social factors fueling innovation and growth.
This dramatic yet positive change that Berlin went through leads us to the question: what role can Tokyo ’ s creative cultures play in laying the foundations for the city ’ s next phase? How can we paint a brighter future by aligning the creative potential of these two cities?
The British Library blog features several art works made during the Vietnam War era. It also quotes Nguyễn Toan Thi, a guerilla artist during the war:

The website Indigenous News analizes a report carried out by BMC Psychiatry which studied 748 children, whose ages range between 9 and 15, from nine different schools attended by low socioeconomic classes in the city of Arica, in northern Chile.
Out of the total number of children that took part of the study, 37% were Aymara.
Aymara families live a traditional lifestyle. Elders advise the youth, mothers take care of household tasks and educate the children, while fathers are the bread-winners and often make family decisions. The study concludes:
This point to an additional benefit of maintaining cultural traditions within this population.

(Photo courtesy of the author.) The recently finalized congress of the Workers' Central Union of Cuba (CTC), the only organization of its kind in the country, concluded with the confirmation that unless there is an increase in productivity, there will be no increase in the salaries of Cuban state workers.
In Cuba, the median salary of state workers stands at 15 dollars per month, according to the exchange rate of Cuba's national currency.
Meanwhile, the cost of living has increased in recent years, after the implementation of economic measures such as the elimination of certain food products from the basic food basket subsidized by the State.
In addition, there has been a significant increase in food prices in the private market.
According to the president of Cuba, Raúl Castro,
“It would be irresponsible and counterproductive to order a generalized salary increase in the state sector, because it would only cause an inflationary spiral unless it is fully backed by a matching increase in the goods and services on offer. ”
Making a salary increase conditional on increased productivity has refocused the debate on the vicious cycle that has ensnared Cuba in recent times.
The recently elected secretary of the CTC, Ulises Guilarte, pointed out the consequences of this cycle:
Salary problems are the main obstacle to increasing productivity and efficiency in many places, causing apathy and lack of motivation and interest in work, with consequent effects on discipline and the exodus of qualified workers towards better compensated and less demanding professional activities, resulting in a tangible decapitalization of the work force, which has fundamentally impacted the basic branches of industry, the construction ministry, and others, as well as ever-increasing denials of promotions to leadership positions.
In his speech, Raúl Castro confirmed that medical workers would receive a salary increase, "given that the country ’ s fundamental income at this time is a result of the work of thousands of doctors offering their services abroad."
In January 2011, the Brazilian ambassador in Havana announced that there would be 11,000 Cuban doctors working in the poorest and most remote parts of his country that year.
The South-South Cooperation, a partner of the Pan-American Health Organization, will give around $500 million dollars to Cuba annually.
On his blog Esquinas de Cuba, Alejandro Ulloa argues:
(...) Without significant foreign investments, as well as the recapitalization of major productive sectors, the Cuban economy will continue in this vicious cycle, which clearly threatens the increase of the purchasing power of wages, the real problem affecting the population today.
Sarzamine Kohan
Protests against a TV series called Sarzamine Kohan (Ancient Land) erupted this week in several Iranian cities, including Dezful and Ahvaz in the oil-rich Khuzestan province.
Demonstrators say the show was insulting to Bakhtiari people and the role its leaders played in Iran's Constitutional Revolution.
In at least one dialogue of the fictional show, Bakhtyaris are said to be "at the service of English", meaning they were traitors.
Sixty members of parliament wrote a protest letter to state-run Iranian television complaining about this representation.
Bakhtiari people, who primarily live in Chahar Mahaal, Bakhtiari and parts of the Khuzestan, Lorestan and Isfahan provinces, played an important role in Iran's history.
Demonstration in Dezful
Freedom Messenger shared several films from a demonstration in Dezful, on Friday 14, 2014.
Several netizens tweeted about the controversial series.
Tevis tweeted
Today they destroy Bakhtiari, tomorrow they will do it with other ethnic groups.
The _ Sina tweeted
Here are the photos of demonstration in Masjed Soleiman on Friday, February 15.
If you demonstrate, do it the right way, without violence.
Mehdi Mohseni previously tweeted
Iran's Third Channel (the one broadcast the controversial series) played Bakhtiari music several times today.

Unfortunately, bird habitats are threatened by development aggression projects and the rapid destruction of the natural environment. In recent years, birdwatching has become more than a fun activity organized by amateurs and scientists across the country.
A few weeks ago, the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines successfully conducted a bird festival in Zamboanga City, located in the southern island of Mindanao.
Zamboanga may have a reputation of being a dangerous city (it figured prominently in the news last year after armed rebels attacked several villages and abducted hundreds of civilians), but it is home to hundreds of bird species, including migratory birds like the Pacific Barn Swallow. One of the organizers of the festival, maiabird, wrote about some of the rare bird species in Zamboanga:
Sadly, it didn't go out into the open but flew into the dense mangroves to hide.
But I did get a good look at the whole bird as it glided out of sight.
The Pasonanca Natural Park is such a wonderful place to go birding in. The place and bird life is amazing (and the trails are easy!) I really, really loved the time I spent there.
We will definitely be back and spend more time discovering more of the forest.

The protest of all protests, Santiago de Chile.
Image from @ SorayaSM
With the slogan "The protest of all causes united", more than 40 civil organisations (with the exception of students) gathered for the 'Protest of all Protests' whereby more than a hundred thousand people met in Santiago to demand a new constitution by way of a constituent assembly.
The convocation of this event for Sunday, March 22, came from the necessity to unite the civil society, to make a petition to the government of Michelle Bachelet to change the current Political Constitution of Chile, which was promulgated during Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship. The constitution has been questioned for its content because it keeps alive ideological characteristics which can limit the democratic action of the current civil society.

Another of the petitions is a universal rights law.
On that subject David Órdenes, coordinator of Movimiento Movilizándonos, told Global Voices that they are demanding a universal rights law focused more on children and young people, "so that from now on this society provides its children with what they need, because they are democracy and social actors... and therefore the protest of all protests has to do with the fact that we are thoughtful and making proposals."
The massive protest played out peacefully until the end of the march, when confrontations with the police force took place. Here are some tweets relating to the course of the day: At the GIGANTIC... Protest of All Protests
In the protest of all protests were the causes that fit into a constitution for all, daughter of a Constituent Assembly

A powerful 8.3-magnitude earthquake hit northern Chile and southern Peru, as well as neighboring areas in Bolivia, during the early evening of Tuesday, April 1, 2014, triggering a tsunami warning for the coastline. Six people died in Chile, including one Peruvian man.
In Peru, there were no reports of significant damage in the three cities where the temblor shook with the most intensity - Tacna, Moquegua and Arequipa.
Peruvians took to Twitter during and after the shaking. There, some said the city of Tacna was without electricity due to electric poles falling over: In the city of Tacna, the movement was strong, the city has no electric power.
Report from Tacna as a result of the powerful earthquake felt seconds ago. Reportedly, there was no electricity or mobile phone service in Moquegua:
Regions of Tacna and Moquegua without electricity.
Movistar and Claro cellphone services have collapsed after the earthquake... From Chile came reports of evacuation from cities along the northern coast in anticipation of a possible tsunami: LATEST NEWS - Evacuation in northern Chile carried out calmly, according to our correspondent in Arica.
PICTURES: This is how Chile's coasts are being evacuating due to the tsunami alert. Likewise, there was also an evacuation order in Peru for several cities in the south of the country:
URGENT: Order of evacuation for Peruvian coastline: Arequipa, Ica, Tacna.
URGENT - EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE: Peruvian authorities tell AFP that they are evacuating the population in the country's south.
URGENT - EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE: Access closed to the Costa Verde from San Miguel, Magdalena, San Isidro, Miraflores and Barranco in Lima.
The first tsunami waves were reported to be arriving to the coasts of Ilo and Tacna in southern Peru:

The leatherback sea turtle.

The Leatherback Turtle Festival, this year in its ninth edition, raises awareness among the general public about this sea turtle, which returns to the beaches of Puerto Rico every year to lay its eggs.
According to the blog CoquíPR:
In Puerto Rico, nesting areas have decreased in number due to the development of beaches and coastal areas.
This loss of habitat is mainly due to construction of residential, tourist, and industrial projects in addition to the expansion of urban zones in coastal areas.
Nonetheless, the reflection of lights in developed areas (such as direct lighting from beaches) produces disorientation for both adult turtles and the hatchlings.
Instead of returning to the sea when they leave the nest, many newborn turtles become disoriented because of the lights and go in the opposite direction, where they are eaten by predators, killed by cars, or die due to exposure to the sun. The adversities that newborn turtles may face in their journeys to the sea can also be added to this.
They can be hurt by pets (like dogs) or preyed upon by seabirds or crabs.
Nest vandalism, egg poaching, and killing of female turtles when they come out to nest are serious problems affecting the species.
Leatherbacks are especially susceptible to ingesting plastic materials at sea when they confuse them with jellyfish. To celebrate the Leatherback Turtle Festival and to help spread information about it, here are five interesting facts about this reptile:
1. The leatherback is the largest species of sea turtle in the world.
Digital magazine Mi Puerto Rico Verde has more information on the physical characteristics of this turtle:
The largest documented leatherback weighed 916 kilograms, equivalent to just over 2,000 pounds.
The leatherback has dark tones with small, round spots that are pink and white.
It is easily distinguishable by its seven streaks shaped like a mountain range running along its shell and by its peculiar, large front flippers.
Females also have a characteristic pink spot at the top of their heads.
2.
The leatherback is the only species of sea turtle that does not have a hard shell.
According to Amigos de las Tortugas Marinas, a community effort dedicated to contributing to protecting leatherbacks:
Unlike other species of turtles does not have a hard shell, but rather a leather cover that has seven longitudinal ridges which to the touch feel have a gummy or rubbery texture.
This shell form, softer than that of other species, is an adaptation to withstand the high pressures when diving into considerable depths than can exceed 3,000 feet, deeper than any other species of turtle.
3. The moon and stars are points of reference for leatherbacks.
Light pollution is a very serious problem for the leatherback when it returns to nest.
Digital environmental magazine Corriente Verde explains why:
Newborn turtles use the reflection of the moon's brightness as a point of reference to know where to go to get to the ocean.
That is one of the reasons why buildings and other structure should not be built close to the sea, since the lights or spotlights from buildings can confuse or mislead both newborn and adult leatherbacks, making them think that the sea is in the direction of the light bulbs.
4.
The female of the species makes the longest migration of any species of sea turtle.
Amigos de las Tortugas Marinas reveal a bit more about the extraordinary lengths that female leatherbacks are capable of traveling:
Female leatherbacks make the longest migration of all of the species of sea turtles.
Among their feeding areas and beaches for nesting, they can make trips of up to more than 3,000 miles or 6,000 km. Leatherbacks are oceanic turtles that live the majority of the time far away from the coast with the exception of their nesting season during which they return to the beaches of the tropics.
After mating at sea, females return to the warm, sandy beaches of the tropics to build their nests and lay between 75 and 100 eggs.
5.
The sex of the leatherback is determined by the temperature of the sand.
Once again, Amigos de las Tortugas Marinas provide more details:
The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the baby turtles, higher temperatures result in females and slightly lower ones result in males.
Therefore, we can think that the eggs at the end that will be hotter because solar radiation onto the sand will result in females and those that are deeper will result in males, but it is not always like this, as there are other factors such as rainfall and waves that can affect the temperature of the nest.
The average nest temperature is about 29.5 ° C or 85 ° F.

Video Volunteers Community Correspondent Gayatri documents in a video one obscure ritual of India, the ‘ Saptami Beti ’, where women celebrate having a son.
She comments:
It is important to talk about this.
I want to show this video in all the areas where ‘ Saptami ’ is celebrated.
People give it so much importance even though it is a rather strange celebration.
Why don ’ t they celebrate their daughters who keep their houses running, the cattle fed and the water tanks filled? Why just their sons? The tradition and rationality behind it are so deeply carved into people … but we can change it.
UPDATE: According to Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, on the evening of Monday, April 14, the flames have left 15 dead, 11,000 homeless, 1,140 acres consumed by the fire, and over 2,500 homes burned, according to the authorities' evaluation.
On the night of Saturday, April 12, a huge fire consumed over 500 homes in the hills of the coastal Chilean city of Valparaíso.
Authorities decided to evacuate 3,000 people and deployed soldiers to the area to help in the disaster.
By Monday, April 14, 2,000 houses had been consumed by the flames and 17,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes.
Emergency crews continue working to reduce the flames that are still spreading throughout the hills of the port.
Eleven sectors have been affected and 850 acres consumed.
Infographic published in El Mercurio.Valparaíso houses the National Congress of Chile and one of the main ports of the country.
That zone was not affected by the fire.
A huge column of smoke, which is causing respiratory problems, especially among children and the elderly, can be seen dozens of kilometers away.
Fire units from six provinces, the police, as well as air and ground teams from the National Forest Service and the National Bureau of Emergency are working to extinguish the fire, which started after 4pm on Saturday and grew as the afternoon wore on.
Most of the houses in Valparaíso, where about 250,000 people live, are built with lightweight, highly flammable materials, which together with the wind causes frequent fires, but never any of this magnitude. Photo on Flickr by user retoricaca (CC BY-NC 2.0)
The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, classified the tragedy as "the worst fire in Valparaíso's history" and suspects that the death toll may increase with the passage of time.

A group of students at Iran's Amirkabir University in Tehran chanted pro-opposition slogans, held placards and waved the Iranian flag during a speech by failed conservative presidential candidate and former top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili on 14 April 2014.
The shouted slogans supported Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, leaders of the Green Movement protests that rocked the country following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's reelection in 2009 by a landslide. Protesters considered the elections results fraudulent, and millions rallied for Ahmadinejad's removal.
But authorities began a widespread crackdown on the movement in early 2010, and Mousavi and Karroubi, both former presidential candidates, as well as Mousavi's wife Zahra Rahnavard were placed under house arrest on 14 February 2011.
Students at Amirkabir University chanted, "Our vote is for imam's prime minister," a reference to Mousavi, who was prime minister from 1980 to 1988 when Ruhollah Khomeini was in power as the country's supreme leader. Meanwhile, conservative Basiji students sitting in the front rows, who support Jalili, chanted "down with the US."
They can be seen toward the end of the following YouTube video, which begins with pro-opposition students:
The main topic of Jalili's main topic was the country's nuclear achievements.
At least nine students who protested during Jalili's speech were called to disciplinary committee.
Hanif Z.Kashani reported:
On Twitter, user amirHP tweeted about the protests:
Jalili came for the nuclear day event but pro-Mousavi slogans are the dominating slogans.

An explosion at Urumqi train station on Wednesday in the far western region of Xinjiang in China killed three people and left another 79 injured, highlighting the grim challenges of security and simmering ethnic tensions in the resource-rich province the size of Iran.
Passengers usually fill train stations this time of the year as a three-day national holiday kicks off on May 1.
State-run media Xinhua News Agency labeled the explosion a terrorist plot and said mobs stabbed civilians with knives and denoted the explosives.
The blast came on the heels of Chinese President Xi Jinping ’ s visit to the region where he vowed “decisive action ” against“ terrorists ”, underscoring efforts by the leadership to prevent isolated attacks from snowballing into a wider crusade to separate Xinjiang, mainly home to the minority Uighurs, who speak a different language.
Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, was the scene of violent ethnic clashes in 2009 that claimed the lives of nearly 200.
The majority ethnic Han have been flocking to the region and now accounts for nearly half of the population.
Beijing says it has brought prosperity to Xinjiang and treated all ethnicities as equals, but Uighur rights groups fault authorities for stifling religious freedom and imposing discrimination.
In response to the train station blast, President Xi said, “We have to realize that the fight against terrorism is long-term, complicated and acute.
The fight against terrorism allows no slackness, and decisive measures should be taken to resolutely suppress terrorists ’ aggression ”.
Train services in Urumqi were suspended for about two hours before they were reopened.
Censors have moved quickly to scrub photos of the blast on Sina Weibo, China ’ s most popular microblogging service, with some state media only posting photos of police standing guard at the scene.
Below are some less politically sensitive discussions remained in Sina Weibo.
Luda Cici wrote:
China has treated ethnic minorities relatively well, and I think it ’ s not the ethnic minorities who are wrong, the reason why terrorists are active in places where ethnic groups live is because they want to let us feel that wherever there are ethnic groups there is terrorism, and by doing so, they hope to separate the ethnic regions.
Xiaoshidai Dafangke, who lives in Xinjiang, urged:
I am in Xinjiang and now I live in a small community, Uighur folks are very kind and have good heart, was carried out by some religious extremists and those who are affected by separatism.
I hope everyone can see the problem in the right way and do not overgeneralize it by blaming the whole ethnic group.
On Twitter, Jan Henryk Dabrowski commented on the ethnic policy:
Like the wrong ethnic policies of the Soviet Union, which caused the Ukraine crisis, the wrong ethnic policies that the Communist Party of China has maintained will also cause bad results. One day, there will be a war between the Han and Uighurs.
Demonstrations in Santiago de Chile.

The first march for education during the current government of President Michelle Bachelet took place on May 8, 2014, with due prior authorization.
The demonstration counted on the participation of several groups. Among them were Student Confederation of Chile (Confech), National High School Students Assembly (ACES), National High School Students Coordinator (Cones), Movement of Higher Education Students (Mesup), Organization of Private Higher Education Federations (Ofesup) and Association of Ministry of Education Officers (Andime).
The march demanded a free quality education as well as active participation in the reform, which is currently being studied.
The newspaper La Tercera reported:
Student march, what is at stake here?
President of Feuc says students want "participation in the reform".
The march was simultaneously carried out in the capital city Santiago and several other locations in the country.
Participation and presence of an important number of students was noticed:
It's good to see that the student march was massive in Santiago and other regions.
United for a new education that builds a better Chile. Thousands of young people participate in the first student march of the year in Concepción.
There were marches in several cities in the countryside too, as in Iquique, Valparaíso, the city that is the seat of the National Congress, and Valdivia.
Unfortunately, in some places the marches were overshadowed by disturbances, mostly caused by people other than students and who had nothing to do with their demands.
Naschla Aburman, president of Feuc, labeled these disturbances as "isolated incidents" and stated that there are things that are outside of the responsibility of the organizers.
Twitter users expressed their opinion regarding these facts, spreading images and information about the consequences:
NOW: Governor Orrego says "there haven't been any incidents" during the student march. However, there were "organized violent people" at the end of it. Universidad Central reported damages around 20 million pesos after the student march.
General Ricardo Solar reports that the number of people under arrest after the student march is 101.

Machu Picchu.

Machu Picchu may be an ancient city, but there are still new things to discover.
A new section of the Inca Trail, the vast network of paths built by the Incan empire, of which some of the most popular with hikers nowadays lead to Machu Picchu in today's Cusco, Peru, has been discovered.
It leads from Wayraqtambo (Wind Inn), behind Machu Picchu, to a lookout spot that provides unique views of the Inca llaqta (village).
Cusco's Decentralized Direction of Culture announced the finding on their website, which was republished by site Cusco 2.0:
The impressive discovered trail is about a kilometer and a half long and between 1.20 and 1.40 meters wide, and it varies according to the land topography.
It can't be fully appreciated yet as it is covered by vegetation, but thanks to the researchers team from Machu Picchu Park, some parts are now free from underbrush and trees that were covering it, thus showing Inca-built containment walls that go up to 3 meters high.
Meanwhile, website Mystery Planet noted:
Today, only 25 percent of the Inca road network can be seen.
The rest of it was destroyed long ago by the conquerors or more recently by modern buildings.
Researchers in Machu Picchu, however, announced the recent finding of a new section of the trail located at the back of Machu Picchu, between the archaelogical sites of Wiñay Huayna and Intipata.
Newspaper La Nación went into further detail:
Inca Trail (Qhapaq Ñan, in indigenous language) is a road network of about 40,000 kilometers that connected Peru, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina and Bolivia whose construction ended during the Inca Empire, with its main part in Peru.
Several governments in the region have jointly asked the UN to declare the Inca Trail as World Heritage Site.
On Twitter, users shared the news, and many of them posted photos and images of the Cusco sanctuary:
New Inca road to Machu Picchu was discovered.
Its 1.5km long and there you can see an Inca tunnel.
Inca trail to Machu Picchu is favorite destination for 'backpackers'.
Even some Catalan users shared the news:

It had been hidden in the rain forest.
Fifteen-year-old Samkeliso Kimbinyi of Zambian origin but based in the United Kingdom, is creating a buzz in the information and communication technology (ICT) world by becoming one of the youngest Microsoft Qualified Professionals in Europe.
The teenager, better known as Sam, is a Year 10 (high school level) student at the University Technical College (UTC) in Reading, a town just outside London.
He is now a Microsoft Certified Professional and has Microsoft Technical Associates (MTA) certificates in seven areas including Software Fundamentals, Windows Development Fundamentals and OS (operating system) Fundamentals.
Kimbinyi has also developed an app called Lite for Windows phones and has so far received positive reviews for the same.
Sam Kimbinyi's photo, taken from his Twitter profile.
Global Voices Online caught up with Sam on email and learned from him first-hand about his achievements:
In March this year, I had the opportunity of meeting staff from Microsoft offices in Seattle, who were in the UK for one day as part of their European trip to speak to clients who are training through the Microsoft IT Academy.
On May 26th 2014 I published my first App — Lite — on the Windows Phone Store.
I got the idea of the app after spending long hours of looking for a fast lightweight flashlight app that did not contain ads.
Eventually, after not finding anything, I decided to make my own.
Eight Days later and with the criticism (sic) from the Reddit Window Phone Community, I reached 300 Downloads and a 5 star rating.
Shortly after, the app got a spot on the “New and Rising ” Section of the app store. In future I hope to release many more apps and continue to study Computer Science at (the) university.
In his college newsletter, Kimbinyi was quoted as saying:
MTA training links to what we're learning in class, but has given me a greater understanding of programming and how diverse the field is.
My new knowledge was really useful when we developed an app during the Microsoft employer project; we ended up developing a much better app.
Microsoft congratulated Kimbinyi in a tweet:

Senior representatives from Twitter, led by its head of global public policy, Colin Crowell, have met with Alexandr Zharov, the chief of Roscomnadzor, Russia's federal communications agency.
After the pow wow, Zharov announced to reporters that Twitter has agreed to create a special representative to Russia.
Based in Dublin, where Twitter has its international headquarters, the world's largest microblogging service will dedicate someone to liaison with the Russian government, to handle legal requests to censor accounts accused of extremism and other crimes.
Twitter hasn't yet decided whom to cast in this new role, though Crowell and his team tomorrow will consult with the Russian Association for Electronic Communications (RAEC), a noncommercial group that brings together major players in Russia's communications market.
Zharov says that Twitter has agreed to obey Russian demands to block access to various "extremist blogs," including the Ukrainian far-right group Pravyi Sektor, which is already unavailable to Twitter users who set their accounts' location to Russia. (Admittedly, this form of censorship is easily circumvented – users need only change their settings.)
How Twitter proceeds from here is still unclear. Zharov's statement implies that Twitter will most likely block more accounts in the future, when Roscomnadzor demands it.
But will Twitter block those accounts in a more effective way? Will Twitter delete the accounts outright?
Zharov claims that his concerns are not limited to Russian users, meaning that Roscomnadzor might insist on account-deletion in addition to account-blocking.
In an official statement on Roscomnadzor's website, the agency says it's sent Twitter a list of 12 accounts identified as extremist by Russia's Attorney General.
"Roscomnadzor expects that administrators will take action to delete these accounts or restrict access to them within Russian territory," reads the press release.
According to Max Seddon at BuzzFeed, Twitter denies that it has promised to delete any accounts.
Today and tomorrow, Twitter executives will ponder whom to tap to be their go-between with Russian censors, but Roscomnadzor hasn't wasted any time naming its contact person, Maxim Kzensov, the agency's deputy director, who made headlines last month after threatening to shut off access to Twitter and Facebook "in a matter of minutes." Kzensov's comments appeared in an interview, where he criticized American Internet giants for failing to establish legal representation in Russia, allowing them to circumvent censorship and taxation laws.
Creating an official liaison to Russia marks an important concession to the Kremlin, but Twitter is stopping short of establishing a formal legal office in Russia.
In May, Kzensov complained that "Twitter and Facebook don't exist legally in Russia," though the latter does have a Russian-language manager based in London.
(Kzensov was likely referring to Ekaterina Skorobogatova, Facebook's Emerging Markets Growth Manager.)
Google, on the other hand, has had an office in Moscow since 2005.
A pattern is emerging in the relationship between the Kremlin and Twitter, where Moscow makes sweeping demands of the website and then touts the resulting compromise as a victory for Russian sovereignty.
The game can't go on forever, however, and it is only a matter of time before Twitter's wiggle room runs out.
As a result, RuNet Echo reported several pieces of information that Twitter says are untrue.

The last time that Argentina reached the final of the World Cup was 1990, when the tournament took place in Italy and West Germany was crowned the champion.
After winning against the Netherlands in a penalty shootout 4-2 on July 9, Argentina will advance to the final once again and dual Germany for the title on Sunday, July 13 in the Estádio Jornalista Mário Filho, better known as the Maracanã.
Esteban Blog summarised the match like this:
A match with a rich tradition of finals approaches, with Germany demolishing the host 7-1, during which Brazil lacked the heart that the Argentines and the Dutch had in excess.
The most iconic locations in Argentina were transformed into party venues and, unsurprisingly, the Argentines at Brazil's Copacabana Beach also celebrated:

Like me, you may have pinched yourself to see if you were dreaming after watching Brazil's humiliating 7-1 defeat by Germany in the World Cup semifinals.
But it happened.
Bloggers from the Middle East and North Africa expressed their sympathy, with one Bahraini Twitter user wryly noting that the "tear gas" team was leaving in a "scandalous manner." He was referring to the government of Bahrain's use of Brazilian tear gas to violently stop protests (warning, link contains graphic content).
Brazil will receive a minimum of $20 million for its semifinal run in the World Cup, but the team still has an opportunity to win an extra $2 million if it defeats the Netherlands, who lost to Argentina, in the third-place game.
This money may be sorely needed to make changes to its soccer association.
Protests continued in the country, but not at the same scale as the lead-up to the tournament.
Some 300 protesters in the city of Sao Paulo turned out to demand the release of previous demonstrators, yet the police responded by arresting six more.
Most fans traveling to Brazil will not have heard any baile funk (dance funk) because it has been banned for its popularity in favelas and for its racy sounds, which feature police sirens and gunshots.
Argentina fans, meanwhile, can rejoice because they will have an opportunity to watch their team play against Germany in the final as Lionel Messi, one of the all time greats, plays with heartthrob Ezekiel Lavezzi beside him in attack. Lavezzi has attracted a few more fans after stripping off his shirt in a victory celebration. With racism, it seems more is less.
The global soccer body FIFA has revealed internal divisions about cracking down on racism at the tournament.
FIFA's task force against racism disagreed with the ruling of its disciplinary panel to decline to punish national federations for racist and homophobic chants by fans because the fans were not targeting one player in particular, but entire teams.
Preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have already been marred by reports of as many as 400 Nepalese and 700 Indian construction workers dying in conditions that can approach 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).
However, one journalism professor in the country argues that the tournament should still be staged because it will allow for sustained pressure on Qatar to improve its human rights record.
He is also the co-author of one of the most comprehensive studies on social attitudes towards media in the Middle East, which you can read here in this fascinating interactive website. His study was funded by the Qatar Foundation, the same organization that sponsors FC Barcelona, home of Lionel Messi.
The foundation is itself funded in part by the government of Qatar.

"One thing is that books satisfy users' curiosity, and a very different one that is that it might represent the identity of the community them belong to". Argentinian librarian Daniel Canosa questions the role and function of local libraries. On Infotecarios network he writes:
Indigneous libraries generate knowledge from local and community participation, provide a way of understanding, that in time is a way of building identity.
The thing is if what libraries provide represent what each community knows, if what a librarian builds with their community allows a true affinity with people's historic memory.
This is not about new ideas, but things should move forward questioning those ideas.
If libraries spread people's production from their own places, then not only the elites won't be then only ones in the world of information. The author highlights the fact that burning libraries, as happened in the past, eliminates peoples' memories and therefore their identity. He also highlights the works by Colombia Indigenous Peoples Basic Library, puts into question publications by Abya Yala Ecuadorian publishing house and presents an instance of "social inclusion" with Eloísa Cartonera Cooperative from Argentina.

In Moscow, an anonymous group of young people climbed atop the U.S. embassy and hung a banner mocking the American President. The sign, pictured above, read, "I see nothing, I hear nothing, and I speak the truth to no one," featuring three caricatures of Obama, likening him to the "three wise monkeys" of the Japanese proverb.
Photographs of the Obama sign amused many in Russia, where Washington's support for the new government in Kyiv has made the United States more unpopular than ever.
The online conversation seems to have changed when your humble RuNet Echo editor started a debate about whether the banner was in fact a racist attack on the first African-American U.S. President.
Tweets about the banner being racist attracted reposts from dozens of people, including the Guardian's Shaun Walker, the Carnegie Endowment's Andrew Weiss, and even Estonian President Toomas Ilves. Dozens more, usually writing from Russia, contested the idea that the sign is racist, arguing that jokes about the "three wise monkeys" are common in political satire.
Thus far, no-one in Cuba has contracted the deadly Ebola virus and the government wants to keep it that way.
Havana Times reports on "increased control measures to prevent the possible introduction of Ebola into Cuba", adding that The Ministry of Public Health and other supporting agencies are being extra vigilant with monitoring any visitors arriving from high-risk countries.

Some months ago, on her blog Anchas Alamedas, blogger Solentiname started to share the different stages she's gone through, since the moment she found a lump in her breast.
Don't worry, this didn't hurt at all.
It has been uncomfortable, but when you manage to overcome something like this, you give up the right to complain, right? I feel almost forced to absolute happiness, to perspective, to the this is better than cancer. And besides that, I don't know how to feel anymore.
I don't feel as if I survived cancer, I don't feel entitled to the label of survivor. I've thought of taking at their word to everyone that asked me to let them know if they could do something for me and I will tell them yes: pay a mammogram to each of your female workers, make a campaign, save at least one life.
She ends up saying:
I am not survivor at all, Mimí. I don't feel life is giving me a second chance of anything.
I don't feel I'm distinct.

Fourteen people were injured after a bomb exploded at Escuela Militar subway station in the Chilean capital of Santiago around 2 p.m.
A woman who works at the cleaning service for firm Metro S.A., who lost the fingers on her right hand, and a 35-year-old, who suffered abdominal trauma, were the most seriously injured. Deputy Secretary of Interior Mahmud Aleuy confirmed that the two people suspected to have carried out the attack fled in a white Chevrolet, but there are also ongoing investigations of a second vehicle, a red Opel Corsa with two men inside.
Santiago subway moved the peak hour ahead to 17: 00 after the attack at Escuela Militar station.
Big explosion at Santiago subway described as "terrorist act" by Chilean government.
UPDATE: Eight people wounded by the explosion at Santiago de Chile subway.
Clearly, this was a terrorist attack at Santiago de Chile subway.
Dear user, Based on the article approved on November 2009 in Parliament (including the law on press, broadcasts and news sites) and by article 7, paragraph (a) on press laws, access to this website due to a lack of license from the Press Supervisory Committee is not possible. To view the licensed media (both in print and digital) visit press.Farhang.gov.ir. To apply for permission to host your website visit e-rasaneh.ir.
Under recent changes to the Iranian government's already-stringent media regulatory regime, all online newspapers are now required to register with the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance through a site called "e-rasaneh" ("e-newspaper" in Farsi), which falls under the jurisdiction of the nation's Press Supervisory Board.
Websites that cooperate with the new regulations will receive six-month subsidies from the Ministry, along with press passes for national events.
State news agency IRNA reported the news after a press conference with Deputy Minister Hossein Entezami in late August.
Entezami asked Iran media industry leaders to cooperate with the new measures, "so the legal environment can fall in line with the nation's press."
"All news and news sites have been notified that based on Article 18 of the press law, which is based on legal matter, they will now be responsible for providing the name and address of the owner, and the director of the media office," he said.
Entezami noted that Iran's Internet boasts a large number of unlicensed news websites, and the Press Supervisory Board would soon begin to block them without discrimination. The Ministry has not yet defined exactly what constitutes a news website. However, Entezami did notify the press conference that Iranians would soon be able to report any news website lacking proper licensing through a online platform run by the supervisory board.
Entezami also noted that websites cooperating can expect to receive their government-issued payments at the end of the Persian calendar month of Shahrivar.
This past week, dana.ir was one of the first websites Iranian users found to be blocked under the new legislation.
These new regulations, and posturing towards more filtering comes alongside President Hassan Rouhani's often liberal-minded statements against filtering and forced regulations. The tweet below, from the President's official account, quotes a televised speech he delivered this past Sunday:
If you set up # filter, somebody'll set up anti-filter.
For many Iranian Internet users, the combination of these regulations with the recent uptick in arrests of online activists and bloggers make it difficult to take Rouhani at his word.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly associated Article 18 of the Press Law with the Cyber Crimes Law.
A screenshot of "Japan China Korea Happy" posted on YouTube on July 18, 2014
Taking inspiration from American singer Pharrell Williams' "Happy" video, a group of university students in Kyoto, Japan are reaching out to the youth in China and Korea with a message of peace and friendship, something that the governments of the three nations have been struggling to achieve.
The description of the video on YouTube reads:
"Japan-China-Korea HAPPY" was made by Japanese university students wishing for the peace between the three countries.
These three countries may have sensitive historical relations, but younger generations are willing to work on to fix and have better relations for the better future. The 'HAPPY' music video makes people smile and happy.
That's why we made this video with young people from the three countries.
This video was mainly filmed in Japan, but also some clips were filmed in South Korea and China.
We hope that this video helps to spread smiles and encourages ever bettering futures for these three countries.
Among non-Japanese nationals living in Japan, ethnic Koreans make up of largest demographic throughout Japan, but Osaka and Kyoto have particularly high ratios of Korean residents compared to ones in other prefectures.
For a travel destination that attracted over one million foreigners last year, Kyoto certainly would not want to promote racism and xenophobia.
The video was made with help of foreign students. Over a hundred students participated in the production of the video including those studying in Kyoto as well as ones overseas.
Muwa Yamada, a Japanese expat in New York, watched the video commented:
Those college kids showing us that we have a constructive positive way to deal with the many issues we have.
I think the bottom line is that we're all breathing the same air.
It has been more than two years since the government officials of Japan, South Korea and China held high-level talks (and they are finally breaking the silence this week at the vice ministers' talk in Seoul to mend their relationship).
The relations among the three have been strained due to disputes over territory and history.
Japan and China have sparred over who owns the Senkaku Islands (China refers to them as Diaoyu, Taiwan as Tiaoyutai), and Japan and South Korea have similarly feuded over the ownership of Takeshima islets (Korea refers to it as Dokdo).
Anti-Japan protests and anti-Korean protests have mutually giving bad impressions of the other, as well.
It seems everyone is excessively influenced by their government.
Once the young generation becomes happy, the relationship between these governments will change. If you keep snarling at each other, there won't be any solution.
Disapproving of the video without taking action is not good.
The video promoting friendship across the three countries was also the target of criticism and at times vicious comments. Most of these comments tried to put a damper on the happy mood by bringing up historical issues and diplomatic problems among the nations. What's the matter with these people bringing diplomatic issues and historical issues to the table, when the video is solely promoting civil exchange among Japan, Korea and China.
Most of the people living in Korea or China should be living a normal life, and not all of them are energetically against Japan.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Beijing and ASEAN summit in Myanmar for Southeast Asian countries plus China, Korea and Japan in coming November, could be the chance for government nationals to thaw their relationship. Written with additional help by Aparna Ray and L. Finch

Image from Valor por Tamaulipas' Google Plus account. "For you we will be strong.
Rosario was a doctor dedicated to informing the community about dangers, with a heart as big as her courage, our Miut3. "Citizen groups in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas reported yesterday that Twitter user María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio ​ ​ had been kidnapped and murdered.
Although it is unknown who was responsible for her death, photographs of Fuentes Rubio's body appeared on her Twitter stream.
After María del Rosario supposedly asked for forgiveness for facing the drug lords, photos of her own murder were published, as well as a posthumous message that warned other citizen journalists to remain quiet about Reyonsa's violence because “you won ’ t get anything out of it. ”
A ​ Reynosa ​ medical doctor, Fuentes Rubio volunteered as a contributor with Valor por Tamaulipas (Courage for Tamaulipas), a citizen media platform that allows users to file anonymous reports on violence, particularly incidents concerning organized crime and the drug trade.
She also served as an administrator for Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas (Responsibility for Tamaulipas), a similar project associated with the first. ​ The last post by "Valor for Tamaulipas" described her as "an angel who gave everything, her life, her future, her safety and peace (...) for the good of the people of the state." ​
This is not the first time individuals associated with these networks have been punished for their reporting.
Since it was established in 2012, Valor por Tamaulipas has faced a range of threats and incidents of violence that at times have forced administrators to pause their activities.
Valor por Tamaulipas has been using social media to crowdsource reports from citizens in the state of Tamaulipas, which has been riddled with drug-related conflict and corruption since 2006.
This conflict has forced many traditional news organizations to curb their reporting on drug violence; the Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that sixteen journalists have been killed in Mexico since 2006, mostly due to their coverage of drug-related crime and corruption. ​ As Darío Ramírez, general director of Article 19 in Mexico and Central America, said: “The violence against the press in Tamaulipas and the lack of protection for freedom of expression by the Mexican authorities has generated information vacuums in issues related to public security, for which social media has become an effective citizen tool to be freely informed about this acts. ” ​
As citizen and social media users work to fill this silence and report on what they see and hear on the ground, groups like VxT and individuals like Fuentes Rubio have become prime targets for drug organizations.
Bolivian President Evo Morales.

There were 6.2 million Bolivian citizens eligible to vote in the 2014 general elections.
The most notable change for this particular election has been that, for the first time, 273,000 citizens have been allowed to vote from 31 outside countries.
Bolivia, where voting is obligatory, has one of the highest voter turnout records in South America.
The same initial counts anticipate that Morales's MAS-IPSP (Movement Toward Socialism - Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the People Party) will have control of two-thirds of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. This data is unofficial and will be confirmed within the next 48 hours.
The two most commonly used hashtags for reporting and commentary during the elections have been # EleccionesBo (Election Bolivia) and # BoliviaElige (Bolivia chooses).
A few days ago, blogger and digital activist Tonny López (@ tonnylp) drew attention to the proliferation of hashtags in the traditional and digital media, where nearly 20 different tags have been put into place:
Think about this: media, citizens, and activists in Bolivia all use their own hashtags for these elections.
XD The responsibility for this gaffe rested with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, who responded via Twitter: # RamiroParedes: The term "Plurinominal" does not affect the legally binding force of the elections.
# TSE: The origin of the printing error on the ballot sheet has not yet been determined; The matter will be investigated starting tomorrow. Just two days before the election, Bolivians looked back on the 32 years since democracy was restored in Bolivia.
Since that time, eight general elections have been held in the country.
Corona Capital Festival.
Photo taken by the author, J. Tadeo.
Poor weather and complaints from fans about the concert's faulty electronic bracelets marked the fourth annual Mexican music festival, Corona Capital, which took place on October 11 and 12, 2014 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (Rodríguez Brothers Racetrack) in Mexico City. The festival featured popular bands and international musicians such as the Black Kids, MGMT, Weezer, Belle & Sebastian, Jack White, and Damon Albarn.
Nevertheless, there were some that enjoyed the weather, such as Ana Laura Calzada:
The bracelets would be the used as a system to get access to the event as the only payment method for food, drinks and official merchandising, and for checking in at the different locations for the festival. They ended up working only for entering and not that well.
It's really tough Last year ’ s festival experienced a letdown when John Talabot canceled his performance a few days prior to the event due to the insecurity posed by the country ’ s organized crime, becoming yet another one of its victims.

About two million people were evacuated, and damage, while limited, was still significant in isolated and rural prefectures such as Okinawa:
Typhoon 19 causes widespread damage over all parts of Okinawa, injuries and flooding reported - October 12 (ANN News)
Twitter users all over Japan shared images of the typhoon.
One Twitter, a user in Okinawa used time-lapse video to graphically show the dramatically falling air pressure preceding the typhoon storm system:
Here's how a potato chip bag changes shape as Typhoon 19 gets closer and closer...
Cool!
By the time the typhoon reached Kyushu, it had all but obscured the western half of Japan from space:
Super Typhoon 19 over Kagoshima Prefecture, as seen from space.
In Fukuoka (the largest city on the island of Kyushu) the storm was powerful enough to uproot trees:
Trees have been toppled over in front of the shops in Fukuoka.
Many towns, such as Saiki in Kyushu's Oita Prefecture, were in danger of flooding from raging rivers and culverts.
Rivers are overflowing in Oita Prefecture's Saiki City, prompting evacuation.
River levels are only expected to continue to rise with a high possibility of damage in the vicinity.
The town of Beppu was the scene of a raging cataract through town:
When we went to the river there was a raging torrent!
Our little plastic umbrella blew away and we're all wet (LOL).
If you happened to fall in the river now it would be the end of you, so best to stay away!
By the time the typhoon reached Kanto and the Tokyo region it had blown itself out, leaving behind beautiful fall weather:

Mexican jurist Ernesto Villanueva survived an attack on the morning of October 29, 2014, as he drove through the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), considered by many to be the country's most prestigious institution of higher learning.
Several shots were fired at Villanueva just outside the building that houses the Institute for Legal Research. Ernesto Villanueva (@ evillanuevamx) has spent much of his career studying the right to information, freedom of expression, transparency, and accountability.
Earlier this year, he was listed among possible candidates to serve as a commissioner for Mexico's Federal Institute for Access to Public Information and Data Protection, the mandate of which is to guarantee access to information.
Photo from his Twitter profile.
In a recently published article in the magazine Proceso, Dr. Villanueva denounced the lack of transparency and other alleged irregularities that overshadowed the appointment of the director of the Institute for Legal Research, in which former Institute director Diego Valadés was also involved.
Several academics, exercising their right of reply in the same periodical, vigorously refuted the allegations made by Villanueva and accused him of discrediting the institution.
In light of the dispute, according to Proceso, Dr. Villanueva suggested that Valadés could have been involved in the criminal acts:
Villanueva identified Diego Valadés, former director of the Institute for Legal Research, as one of those who could have been behind the assault on the Mitsubishi vehicle he was driving when it was struck by three 38-caliber shells from an unknown gunman.
Reports indicate that Villanueva was unharmed.
Twitter user Carlos Brito shared his comments about the commission of such a violent act:
Enough is enough!
Dr @ evillanuevamx was attacked WITHIN the university campus. We stand in solidarity.
Strength.
In solidarity with Dr. Ernesto Villanueva, @ evillanuevamx, who denounced an attempt on his life.
Dr. Villanueva has published a variety of articles on current affairs in his Mexico, chief among them are accounts of the explosion of violence in his native Michoacán and the high public transit cost for commuters in Mexico's capital city.
GV Face: To Vote or Not to Vote?
These general elections are the first under Tunisia's new constitution and the second since the 2011 uprisings that overthrew Ben Ali.
Tunisia served as the spark for the Arab Spring that rippled across the MENA region in 2011.
Uprisings in other countries have led to political stalemates, military takeovers or continued violence, but things have been different in Tunisia.
More than 9000 candidates from over a 100 parties are contesting in this election, and for the first time in the country's modern history, Tunisians cannot predict which parties will win.
Some Tunisians have made the deliberate choice of not voting, while others have decided to concentrate their votes on a few political forces and alliances that are deemed capable of amassing a majority of ballots.
In this episode of GV Face, our video hangout series, GV's MENA editor Amira talks to GV author Ahmed Medien and election observer Emir Sfaxi.
We talk to them about their hopes and expectations, the process of the elections and the changes that these elections might bring in the 5 next years.

Roberto Gómez Bolaño as El Chavo del Ocho. Image published under a Creative Commons license. Roberto Gómez Bolaños, known as "Chespirito" (or "little Shakespeare"), one of the most beloved comedians in Latin America, died November 28 in Mexico at the age of 85.
Chespirito was one of the most successful producers in Mexico.
He started his career as creative producer in advertisement, and then worked as a script writer for radio and film.
Later, after the 1970s, he became a producer, actor and director of his own show. There, he created numerous characters which circulated around the world and entered Latin America's popular culture.
The first character to became famous from his show was Latin American hero "El Chapulín Colorado," a short and clumsy superhero armed with a plastic hammer (el Chipote Chillón), who resolved every problem because he had everything "coldly calculated."
In this universe of characters, the letters CH were a personal signature.
Later, Chespirito recreated a humble neighborhood and in it gave life to El Chavo, an 8-year-old orphan who shared with his neighbors, went to school and dreamed about a simple "torta" (sandwich) of ham.
Others characters were El Doctor Chapatín, El Chómpiras and Chaparrón Bonaparte (under the section "Los Chifladitos" or The Little Crazy Ones).
His shows were broadcast on Mexican television and in almost every country in Latin America.
Even now, 40 years later, Chespirito's shows air in different languages and continents.
For a long time, false rumors about his death circulated on social media due to his deteriorating health since 2009.
He experienced a second wave of popularity in the mid-2000s thanks to the cartoons based on his work and later with his Twitter account, which has more than four million followers and receives daily compliments for all his accomplishments.
People, including Mexico's national soccer team, said goodbye to the legend on social media:
Your legacy will always be with us.
Rest in peace Roberto Gómez Bolaños
Cristian Fernando shared the most popular characters in a picture:
Roberto Gómez Bolaño has died.
Chespirito's characters in one photo. Eduardo Marín described how much the character Chapulín Colorado is loved:
Here, we love Chapulin more than Batman.
What sad news, rest in peace.
At the same time, Sergio Marentes and Raúl Ramírez summarized Chespirito's legacy:
Roberto Gómez Bolaños has died, but Chespirito is immortal. Who ever said immortals die?

Gabriela García Calderón is a committed and ever-friendly Global Voices member who has tirelessly contributed great content and built up this vibrant, decade-old community since joining in 2007.
She is one of the most regular and prolific contributors and was acting editor for Latin America.
Global Voices (GV): When Juan Arellano interviewed you back in July 2009, you had been a translator for GV Spanish for almost two years.
Above all, you spent some time as acting GV editor for Latin America.
Please tell us about the stages of your involvement within Global Voices.
Gabriela García Calderón (GGC): It was all a gradual process. I started in late 2007 as volunteer translator for GV in Spanish and two years later, Eddie Avila, then regional editor, invited me to be an author.
I became then a volunteer translator and an author.
When our former editor Silvia Viñas had her maternity leave, she asked me to fill in for her during the two months of her leave. And when she decided to change jobs, I was asked to fill in for her provisionally.
In the meantime, I've also written some posts for Rising Voices, and I am currently helping Eddie Avila with his Rising Voices Amazonia Project.
GV: Did your experience of translating, authoring and editing change your vision of the world during this time?
GGC: Yes, it made me think a lot more about the people affected by any news or event we report.
The news aren't just about a crash or a rally anymore, it's about some girl that tweets how she felt sick when tear gas was thrown next to her, or an aid woker who shares his thoughts after seeing directly the effects of a typhoon.
GV: Does your work with GV impact your practice as a lawyer?
GGC: Being part of GV has made me more sensitive to what happens in the world.
Likewise, when I read about a legal case, I tend to focus on how it is affecting someone and try to enforce law.
We read about so many place where people don't get justice, that I feel lucky from my place in the world to be able to help someone to feel their rights are respected.
GV: Did the social media scene change a lot in Latin America since, say, 2009?
GGC: Back in 2009, Twitter wasn't as used as it is right now.
Now, politicians express their thoughts via Twitter and sometimes they create quite a buzz with just 140 characters.
GV: You are also an active blogger.
What place does your blogging hold in your daily life?
GGC: My blog has brought me many happy moments, many good friends in very diverse countries and the idea that sharing every day events and incidents is worth while, no matter how insignificant we feel they are.
It's amazing how similar ideas and thoughts we may find when we face any given simple situation, no matter if it happens in Peru, in Spain or in Qatar. GV: Could you also elaborate somewhat on how you manage your own time for all these tasks, including your work as a lawyer?
Any tips?
GGC: Each day brings its own troubles.
What I do every day is divide my activities and see which ones have priority.
If a post on GV has to be published right away, everything else will have to wait. The same goes with all other activities.
I end up checking my e-mail at some point and carrying out some tasks to reduce my week work load.
GV: Anything else you'd like to add?
GGC: I wish GV a happy tenth anniversary, and I wish many more anniversaries to come.
I am so glad to belong to this incredible community, where everybody counts as one and where everybody has their own share to say.
And that's only a slight exaggeration: we do have a small core of staff and editors, but the real engine of Global Voices is our volunteers, who make up 96% of the community.
Many editors and staff members also started out as volunteers.
So on this International Volunteers Day, we pay special tribute to the hundreds of Global Voices volunteers who've worked so hard over the past 10 years to keep the world informed about under-covered events and stories in their particular corners of the globe.
Thank you, GV volunteers — we'd literally be nowhere without you!
Get to know more about our volunteers by reading our series of GV community member profiles, and learn more about volunteering for Global Voices here.
Photo: Laura Schneider Since Argentinian troops landed on the Falklands Islands 32 years ago and sparked a war with the United Kingdom in a bid to recover a territory that was under the South American country's control prior to 1833, relations between the two countries have typically been tense On November 19 the Argentinian parliament passed a law which establishes that all public transportation including sea, land, air transport is obliged to use the legend: "Las Malvinas son Argentinas" (The Malvinas are Argentine).
The fundamental idea behind the law is to strengthen the country's sense of history.
Among islanders the feeling is often different.
Kris Thorsen, a Falkland resident recently presented a petition that prohibits the flying of the Argentinian flag on island territory as he claims it generates discomfort among the population.
The country's main civilian airport carries a sign that advises all arriving passengers not to use any Argentine insignia in Falkland territory.
When it was pointed out to us, we changed it.
As pics in this morning's Mail show. — Jeremy Clarkson (@ JeremyClarkson) octubre 4, 2014 In another, more sarcastic tweet, Clarkson thanked the Argentine government: We had planned a good ending for the show.
The program will be shown on the BBC on December 27 and 28.
It is worth recalling that during the 2014 World Cup, FIFA fined the AFA (Argentine Football Association) for displaying an Argentine flag emblazoned "Las Malvinas son Argentinas" during the team's matches in the tournament.
And back at the Olympics in 2012 a video filmed in the Falkland Islands and made by the Argentine president's office sparked controversy for promoting the team under the slogan To compete on English soil, we train on Argentine soil. It would be surprising if the airing of the show this weekend did not cause yet another round of controversy.

One of the most challenging motor racing in the world, Dakar will begin on January 4 and will tour three Latin American countries: Argentina, Chile and Bolivia during 13 days.
2015 edition will start from Buenos Aires on the 4th and will and will cross cities like Villa Carlos Paz, San Juan, Chilecito and heading through the Andean Montains to reach Copiapó in Chile, Antofagasta and Iquique.
After that, the road splits to Uyuni, in Bolivia.
The difference with 2014 edition is that Peru will not be part of the road.
Since year 2009, the competition develops in Latin America after the killings of four french citizens and three mauritanians military personnel in 2008.

The idea of Hösėg is simple: when you buy a jacket, you give another one to a child in the Peruvian highlands, according to Juan Carlos Sznak, one of the promotors of the iniitiative:
Our message to children when we hand them the jackets goes beyond the simple fact of getting them warm, it's to bring them love and affection.
The jackets are personally delivered by Sznak and his brothers, the brains and hearts behind Höség.
Street vendors are asking the Catholic Church to stop the government from evicting them in Luneta Park.

Small vendors have been evicted from Luneta Park in Manila a few days before the arrival of Pope Francis in the Philippines.
The pope is scheduled to hold a mass in Luneta, the country ’ s premier freedom park.
The head of the Roman Catholic Church will be in the Philippines from January 15 to 19.
His visit is expected to draw millions of people in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which is the largest Catholic-dominated nation in Asia.
Luneta has around 350 vendors, many of whom had been in the park for more than 10 years.
Most of the street vendors sell food items and drinks.
Last week, the vendors were told to evacuate the park in preparation for the papal visit.
The National Parks Development Committee claimed that this was a directive from the police and the presidential palace as part of the security arrangements for the arrival of the pope.
The vendors protested the eviction notice and asserted that they are not a threat to the pope:
We love the Pope.
We will not harm him.
We are not terrorists.

Gerry Serue, spokesperson for the Kilusan Para Sa Disenteng Kabuhayan (Movement for Decent Livelihood), criticized authorities for using the pope ’ s name to destroy the livelihood of the poor:
Pope Francis is known for his affinity with the masses and his being critical on issues of dignity and rights of the underprivileged, but now they are using his name to remove us from the places of our livelihood.
He also invoked the theme of the papal visit, “Mercy and Compassion ”, to defend the right of the vendors to remain at the park:
We know that the Pope does not want this to happen.
The theme of his visit is Mercy and Compassion, where is the mercy and compassion in what the local government officials are doing?
Luneta vendors hold a placard which reads: "Vendors not a threat to the life of our dear pope."

Some vendors also questioned if commercial food stalls will replace them in the park.
They noticed that McDonald ’ s is one of the sponsors of the tarpaulins printed by the Catholic Church. Former legislator Teddy Casino asked if McDonald ’ s food kiosks will be allowed in the park: During the # PopeFrancisPH mass at Luneta, street vendors are banned but not McDo kiosk?
Vendors are worried that they will lose their livelihood during the pope's visit.
Many also fear that the eviction order will be implemented permanently since local authorities have been trying to ban vendors from the park for many years already.
Catholic Church officials acknowledged the petition of the vendors, but they said the issue should be resolved by the local government.
Afghanistan's provinces written in Pashto.
Tajiks and other Dari-speaking ethnic minorities fear that the language will dominate theirs as a result of Pashtun political power.
Wikipedia image.
Salahuddin Rabbani, Afghanistan's new minister of foreign affairs and son of the country's murdered former president Burhanuddin Rabbani, is facing a barrage of criticism for beginning his pre-approval speech to the Afghan parliament in Pashto. The fiercest criticism is coming from Rabbani's Dari-speaking ethnic kin, who feel betrayed that he chose to speak in a language that is not his native tongue.
Pashto and Dari are the two official languages of Afghanistan according to the constitution.
Dari is also the preferred language of several of the country's non-Pashtun ethnic groups, including the large Tajik minority Rabbani hails from. *
Shortly after the speech on January 27, Abdullatif Pedram, the leader of the National Congress Party of Afghanistan and an ethnic Tajik, wrote a widely circulated Facebook post criticizing the new coalition government of Afghanistan and calling it “illegal ” and“ anti-constitutional ”.
Salahuddin Rabbani had “betrayed native language and Farsi culture, ” Pedram added.
When Salahuddin starts the first part of his speech in Pashto, it means that Pashto is the first language in this land. Based on this, representatives of foreign countries will also come to the same conclusion.
This is an infidelity to native language and rich Farsi culture … I respect and love all languages in my country, including Pashto.
But the issue is one of justice.
Farsi is the language of the majority (in Afghanistan).
Many expressed their agreement with him:
Dear Dr. You are right.
What else you can expect from those who trade their identity?
Others accused Pedram of nationalism. Ahmad Wali Hakimi chastised:
Mr. Pedram, it is pity you are spending your education and priceless life (discussing) useless things.
You have betrayed the nation, you are sick …
He would be better off speaking English as he has British citizenship.
In actual fact Afghan media reported that the country's lower house had approved the cancellation of Rabbani's British citizenship on January 26, paving the way for him to be approved as foreign minister January 27.
Ghani, for instance, included Ahmad Zia Massoud, a Tajik and the brother of the legendary Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud in his presidential team.
Many ethnic Tajiks criticised Ahmad Zia Massoud for siding with Ghani rather than his presidential rival Abdullah Abdullah, a half-Pashtun-half-Tajik who was one of the Ahmad Shah Massoud's closest friends before the latter's assassination in 2001.
Rabbani, who was Afghanistan's Ambassador to Turkey in 2011, is foreign educated and viewed as technocrat, despite having strong Tajik tribal connections through his late father. By beginning his speech in Pashto, he may have sought to smooth the ethnic and linguistic divides in the country. Instead, he seems to have aggravated them further. * For a language map of Afghanistan, click here.

"The great March of Change", in Madrid, Spain.

More than 100,000 people filled Puerta del Sol, a plaza in the heart of the Spanish capital and a landmark of protests in recent years, asking for change on Saturday, January 31.
Demonstrators across the political spectrum, of different ages, and from several cities in Spain gathered in Madrid in what is now known as the “Great March for Change ”.
The rally was called by Podemos, a political party founded just one year ago that nevertheless won five seats in the European Parliament, positioning itself as a potential winner of the Spanish general elections in 2016.
The party has a strong commitment to citizens and has collected ideas raised during the years of outrage and protest following the financial crisis that rocked Spain. Responding to Podemos' call for the march, citizens turned up by the tens of thousands, giving the party massive support in the streets.

This time, however, unlike previous demonstrations the outrage was not the only reason for the rally-the will to join forces to change the system was also at the heart of the movement. "Yes, we can" was the most heard cry, also chanted in other rallies of recent years, to express that citizens feel empowered to end corruption and the reign of a political elite that does not look out for their interests.
"We dream, but we take our dreams very seriously," was the most repeated phrase by Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos party leader who organized the march through a viral online campaign.
He began his speech by referring to Greece, which has elected the Syriza party, which opposes the European elite, to form a government.
Greece is the first country that will reject austerity measures, according to Podemos, and the party plans for Spain to be the second with it leading the government.
Spain faces the problems of inequality, poverty, and exclusion, Iglesias said, denouncing the country's recent governments. He also presented proposals for change as a way of stressing the need to take a left turn: "2015 is the year of change for Spain and Europe. ”
Several generations listen to the leader of Podemos.

The leader paid tribute to activist groups that have fought to defend people's rights in the past and now: the teachers and students that formed a green tide in defense of education, the white coats who locked themselves inside hospitals for public health care, women who fought for the right to abortion, "the tireless grandparents" who have struggled for social justice for future generations, the “deceived people" who have fought against the banks, and migrant workers who have struggled to stop evictions. "Thanks for being the popular movement that will allow the change. Never again a country without its people, ” he concluded.
Twitter users have used the social network to share photos and videos of the event, the reasons for their participation in the march, and even their dreams about that day:

Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken around the world, only a small fraction are found on the Internet.
Even though more and more communities are beginning to discover the possibilities of sharing their language online, much more can be done to raise awareness and highlight these efforts.
For International Mother Language Day on February 21, Rising Voices, along with our organizing partners the Living Tongues Institute, Endangered Languages Project, and Indigenous Tweets, as well as a wide range of participating partners, are coming together to launch the campaign “Tweet in Your # MotherLanguage. ”
Through this online campaign, we want to recognize and encourage Internet users who are sharing their language on Twitter with a special focus on indigenous, endangered and minority languages, all of which may not be as well represented online.
It's easy to get involved:
Step 1 – Tweet in Your Mother Language
Tweet using your mother language throughout the day Share “Why is it important to use your language on the Internet? ”
Tweet greetings or your favorite words / phrases in your language Tweet a translation to encourage speakers of other indigenous and minority language communities
Step 2 – Add Hashtags
Add the hashtag # MotherLanguage Add the hashtag of the language (i.e. # Lakota, # Yoruba)
Step 3 – Join the Conversation!
Find others using the # MotherLanguage hashtag and retweet them Search for the hashtag of your mother language and follow others tweeting in it Connect with other people celebrating language diversity
For more details on how to take part, take a look at the campaign website.
Why Tweet in Your # MotherLanguage?
Despite the increase in the number of languages being used online, many communities still face ongoing challenges when trying to communicate through social media.
Some languages lack a keyboard that allows users to write in their language, and many parts of the world still lack adequate connectivity, excluding them from the online conversation.
However, Internet communication has proven to be an important part of language preservation and revitalization.
Easy-to-use digital tools allow for more people to create content in their language, and the Internet for speakers of these languages to connect, regardless of geographic distances.
This campaign will highlight the work of many individuals and groups committed to using their languages on the Internet, many of whom may be considered "language digital activists" for their role in bridging this divide and encouraging a new generation of speakers.
We are fortunate to count the participation of "ambassadors" such as Rodrigo Pérez (@ ISF _ MX) from Mexico, who regularly tweets in the Zapotec language and Ignacio Tomichá Chuve (@ MonkoxBesiro) from Bolivia, who regularly tweets in the Bésiro (Chiquitano) language, who created these videos extending an invitation to participate in the campaign.
More ambassador videos are on their way and will be added to the playlist:
Thanks to help of many people around the world, the campaign website has already been translated in more than 25 languages, including Odia, Sena, and Lezgian.
Many of these translations came from members of the Global Voices' Lingua Project, a community of volunteer translators.
With your help, we can pave the way for a more multilingual Internet where different languages are celebrated, not excluded.
All it takes is a tweet or retweet!

Locusts, plague, waste disposal issues, famine and now floods. Madagascar has been going through extremely difficult times, but none of that has shaken the morale of Malagasy people, just as the country ’ s stagnant economy hasn ’ t prevented its people from innovating and creating.
Antananarivo and other towns in the area have been on high alert following the floods that hit the region after torrential rains.
The flooding reached tragic proportions on 26 February, when one of the dykes surrounding the capital burst.
Other dykes subsequently collapsed, causing extensive damage throughout the region.
Residents, who have already had to endure the unrelenting dilapidation of the roads, are left wondering what new challenges they are going to have to face.
Official authorities report that as of March 3, 20 people have died, at least 41,581 people had their home affected by the floods, and 71,854 people have been displaced.
Floods in Antananarivo posted by @ MiranaPriscilla on Twitter (used with her permission)
The government has already received a fair amount of criticism for suggesting that residents should use public transport to solve the traffic problems caused by the state of the roads.
Now there are delays in disaster relief and the government does not seem to have any suggestions.
While waiting, residents have been documenting the damage caused by the floods with hashtags such as # tondradrano and # madaflood:

Another dramatic video by John Radriarimalala posted on Facebook shows the rising flood waters in the town of Ampanefy:
As does this one by Mbolatahina Raharijaona taken from the centre of the town:
Tsimok'i Gasikara's blog describes the state of alert of the people living near the dykes:
Currently, Atsimondrando (southern Tana) is the worst affected area.
Rescue workers are calling for everyone to show solidarity in providing assistance, which indicates that the response so far has been inadequate.
So there is a state of total chaos in the town, indeed the whole country.
People have been left to fend for themselves amidst rubbish that hasn ’ t been collected for ages, flooded homes, rough roads, and on top of all that, the price of basic essentials is soaring.
The country is going under completely, in both the literal and figurative senses of the word! Although the inventory of damage is far from complete, photos of the buildings in the capital speak for themselves.

It may well be that in the short term, residents will have no one to rely on but themselves to overcome these obstacles.
But it is becoming quite urgent for the displaced population that national solidarity for rescue and recovery get started as soon as possible.

A campaign on IndieGogo is trying to raise funds to rebuild Gaza's only school for disabled children, which was destroyed during Israel's so-called "Operation Protective Edge" last summer.
The Save Gaza Project was launched by Dr. Basel Abu Warda, a doctor at Al Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital, and Mostafa Asi, a human rights activist, with the goal of raising $35,000 by April 10. At the time of this writing, 91 percent of the fundraising goal had been reached, with $31,768 donated by over 500 contributors.
Using the hashtag # GazaWheelChairs, Dr. Abuwarda explained how contributions will benefit the children at the school:

The campaign is being run in collaboration with the Society of Physically Handicapped People, a Gaza-based NGO established in 1992 by "a group of intuitive physically disabled youths."
As they explain on the IndieGogo page, the Society "was the first NGO in the Gaza Strip to provide opportunities for disabled youth to practice their rights in establishing and leading their organizations."
It continues:
"The Society of Physically Handicapped People aims to encourage, empower and enable those with physical disabilities by educating them to exercise their rights, helping them to succeed in reaching their goals, and assisting them in achieving as much integration into the community as possible.
The Society of Physically Handicapped People provides comprehensive healthcare and medical rehabilitation, education and training, psycho-social programs and services to more than 11,600 beneficiaries with permanent physical disabilities in the Gaza Strip through its specialized medical and education centers in Gaza and Rafah. "
Dr Abu Warda also posted this campaign video explaining how the school benefits hundreds of Gaza's disabled children.
Two Indonesian charities, Akhwat Bergerak, an Islamic Women's Movement, and ACT Indonesia, a humanitarian organization, are supporting the campaign.

Rural voices in Cambodia are often left unheard in cyberspace. Thanks to the work of the Cambodian Center of Human Rights (CCHR), a new project has been training and supporting new female bloggers hailing from rural communities across the country, where they can learn to tell their story online.
These young people's university studies brought them to the capital city of Phnom Penh, enabling them to access this opportunity and connect with others with similar backgrounds and experiences.
The project called "Empowering Cloghers" recently wrapped up its first phase after receiving a Rising Voices microgrant in 2014.
The term "clogher" refers to female bloggers in Cambodia.
In addition to the workshops on how to create and maintain their own personal space on the web using the WordPress platform, trainers also encouraged the new cloghers to explore issues and challenges facing rural Cambodia, as well as to provide a snapshot of daily life in this part of the country.
To bring out the best in these new cloghers, the project organized a contest to find the most interesting blog posts, where three winners were chosen. At a ceremony called "Cloghers Corner" held in November 2014, the three winners and all participants of the project were recognized.
The following are excerpts from the winning blog posts:
Working Conditions of Women in the Textile Sector Many rural Cambodians find themselves with the need to migrate to other parts of the country in order to find steady employment.
However, the tough work environments that they face are often not noticeable from the outside, in particular in the textile industry, where the Ministry of Commerce estimates that 90% of workers in this sector are female, which totals approximately 300,000.
In addition to relatively low wages that are not enough to raise a family, workers face other types of hardships.
Sum Dany spoke with some of these textile workers, who recounted some of their stories of their working conditions.
Within that context, there is a woman who works in a nearby factory who said: “My union was not so strict but what is difficult for me is the restroom break, we could not go there for more than three times otherwise we will be asked or blamed.
What ’ s more difficult is the doctor, his / her words are very harsh and there was never enough medicine when people got sick.
They only brought those who fainted to be placed on the bed and then started coin massage.
They don ’ t allow to put the patients on the hospital beds because of the smell, it was very hard.
The doctors / nurses always blame us.
I wonder what the beds are for, if not for the workers who getting sick? ”
Rural Families Struggle Hard to Keep Students in Schools
While there are more and more students from rural areas coming to the larger cities to continue their post-secondary education, most of these young people complete their primary and secondary education in rural schools. These communities present challenges such as young people required to help with household or field-related chores.
Poverty also comes into play as many parents are unable to pay costs related to keeping their children in school, especially when it's time to pay additional related costs.
Chroeng Sopheakvirya wrote about the schooling system in Kandal Province, located in southeast Cambodia, and how sometimes to get additional benefits the rural teacher is paid extra for extra classes by the parents.
However, some parents are unable to pay the extra sum, but schooling goes on as usual:
Parents sometimes owe the payment, but their children still come to class, and teachers still teach them as usual.
This kind of situation occurs as a result of understanding.
River Clean Up in Phnom Penh

In an effort to adapt and become more involved with their new surroundings, many students are taking part in local activities. Cheng Sreymom recently took part in a river clean-up along the Tonlé Sap and Mekong Rivers, which are important parts of the city's landscape. Unfortunately, the rivers have alarming levels of pollution due to wastes that flow into the river.
Trash can also be seen along the riverbanks, and she joined an effort to pick up trash making this part of her new community a little bit better for more to enjoy, and wrote about her reasons for taking part.
The riverside is one of the attractive touristic sites in Phnom Penh, both national and international tourists and their families have always visited here in order to catch fresh air and to relax.
However, it is very unfortunate because some of our citizens lack knowledge about the environment, always throwing away trash improperly causing the touristic site to be dirty and smelly making the tourists wrongly perceive of our society.
I, Apochhceng am one of the citizens who participated in this campaign to clean the city.
I feel that we all have to change our bad habits in order to improve ourselves in order to become a good citizen with good morals for both ourselves and the entire society.
While the first phase of the project has come to an end, the experience working with new cloghers across Cambodia has motivated the CCHR to look for additional ways to support new voices.
The CCHR's Executive Director Sopheap Chak is seeking to crowdfund future activities.

The Muisca language is officially extinct.
The language, part of the Chibcha linguistic family, was previously spoken by the Muisca people, who lived around Colombia's central highlands including the area surrounding present-day Bogotá.
Much of the language's history is found in texts and documents from the 16th and 17th centuries, rescued from archives where they sat dormant.
The language's path towards extinction was cemented by the ruling of King Charles III of Spain, who banned its use as a way to further control the indigenous population.
The law remained until Colombia's 1991 Constitution was passed.
Even though the language is not actively used, it remains alive and well in some of the daily words used by Colombians, which were borrowed from the Muisca language.
These words, usually used to describe local animals, plants, and fruits, are called "muisquismos," and are often used in and around Bogotá by residents unaware of the words' origins.
Logo of the Muysccubun project.
The historical importance of this extinct language piqued the interest of a group of linguistics and anthropology students from various universities around Colombia, which has been working to slowly bring the language back.
By taking advantage of digital tools, apps, and social media, the project called "Muysccubun" has been working to document and share the language on the Internet.
Their activities include transcribing primary source materials in Muisca and uploading to a wiki.
They have created a Spanish-Muisca online dictionary, also available as a free Android app.
This material is also shared through the group's Facebook Page, where they have been sharing the Muisca word of the day linking to the documentation on the wiki.
For example:
Pedro Muller reflects on the lapse of the school system, an institution he says meant for a different historical context.
In this regard, he notes the importance of two similar, but at the same time different, concepts: "to study" and "to be educated": To be educated goes beyond memorizing a couple of names and forgetting them the next day.
It is about having an inquisitive mind and wondering about what hides behind the obvious, it is to acquire skills, to exercise your lateral thinking, a divergent thinking that many call "thinking outside of the box". To be educated is also about learning to be creative and innovative.
We learn better in groups; it is part of our nature to discuss, think and reflect on a specific topic and draw conclusions.
It is said that the best way to became educated is to learn. Muller invites readers to watch the following English-language video, wherein Logan LaPlante talks about the concept of ​ ​ "hacking education" or "hackschooling", which refers to the process of learning as a group experience, based on trial and error and, above all, the importance of creativity.

Tanzania is set to make a historic shift away from English and replace it with Swahili as the language of instruction in the country ’ s schools.
The new education system launched by President Jakaya Kikwete on February 13, 2015, in line with National Vision 2025 will also extend basic education from seven years to 11 years, provide free education at primary and education levels and abolish national examinations for primary school levers.
This appears to be one of the first times that a country in Africa will teach students at all levels in an African language instead of a foreign language.
Commenting on the language shift, Atetaulwa Ngatara, the assistant director for policy at the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, said English will still be taught as a language, but for students to learn English it's not necessary that all their subjects be taught in it.
An article about the policy shift posted on Facebook by Oliver Stegen, a Swahili speaker of German origin and a linguistic advisor at language development non-profit SIL International, elicited mixed responses.
Paul A Kijuu commented in Swahili saying that English has turned the educated class into robots:
On my side, Oliver Stegen I see this as the right move. Our problem is complaining.
Education has to be given using the language that the user understands.
English does not help us apart from turning us into robots.
Our educated elites do not think independently because they do not understand what they studied.
Vera Wilhelmsen noted that not everyone needs to go to university but everyone deserves a good basic education: I think it is important to consider what kind of basic education will benefit the most people.
It is clear that per today not very many people make it to secondary school, and even fewer graduate from it.
There is a problem when neither students not teachers are equipped to make the switch from Swahili to English in secondary school.
Of course we have to watch for the effects, but I also do think it is a good step forward.
Not everyone needs to go to university, but everyone deserves a good basic education!
However, not everyone was in support of the new education system.
Steve Nicolle pointed out one possible effect of the new policy:
I suspect one effect of this legislation will be an increase in enrollments in private schools that continue to offer tuition in English.
Keep an eye open for politicians opening new English medium schools in the near future!
Elly Gudo agreed with Steve Nicole, arguing that politicians will be the main beneficiaries of the policy:
I totally agree with Steve Nicolle.
Having lived in Tanzania, I can tell you for sure that politicians are the highest beneficiaries of this new policy.
Majority of Tanzanian middle and all upper classes who have identified with the global village will do anything to take their children to English Medium Schools.
The common man's child will then be highly disadvantaged when it comes to University admission and by extension job acquisition.
After 2 decades, the country will be highly classified.
Tanzania needs a French-type Revolution in many facets.
Opposing the policy, Muddyb Mwanaharakati said the following in Swahili:
Oliver Stegen do not make me laugh.
They have politicised the issue.
Their children go to international schools.
We, the poor ones, will continue with going to under performing and poorly equipped schools and continue with our English of ya, ya, yes no yes no.
At the same time their children are speaking English fluently.
We are still very far, Oliver, even public notices and government information in many places are still in English.
Josephat Rugemalira observed that the new policy is not as radical as people think:
You need to read carefully what the policy says: it says Swahili will be used at all levels and ALSO says English will be used at all levels (that means including primary level).
So my interpretation is that the only NEW thing made possible by such statements is that it is possible now for some people to establish Swahili medium secondary schools, and it is now official that local government authorities can convert existing primary schools to become English medium.
Reacting to the same article posted on Trending Kenya, Margaret Njeru explained that the new system does not kick out foreign or second languages but put them in their appropriate places in the learning process:
Indeed, bold and in the right direction.
Education is about development, and that development can only come through a language a people make sense of.
The world over, none of the so-called developed economies operates in a foreign language, and the use of the former colonial languages in many African countries has definitely contributed to the marginalization of the majority in the development process.
If we have to define "our" development path, then the language choice must go hand-in-hand with it.
And this does not in any way mean kicking out the foreign (or second languages), rather putting them in their appropriate place in the learning process.
Kwame Aboagye said it is time Africans used their languages:
It is about time that our African countries should speak our own dialects such as Twi, Yoruba, Swahili and Mandingo.
English wasn't our original language in the first place and we need to wake-up and go back to our principals with pride.
The shift is monumental but it comes with significant challenges, noted Christina Higgins:
What good news indeed.
Now the big test will be how to transition to Swahili in terms of materials, exams, and more.
Despite challenges, this shift is truly monumental.

The Aymara Indigenous University of Bolivia "Túpac Katari" (Unibol) attracts students from across the Bolivian Altiplano, who are looking for a better future and a way to give back to their communities. Named after the 18th-century indigenous rebellion leader, the university was created in 2008 by the Bolivian government as a way to embrace traditional knowledge and to provide opportunities to study fields that can be of help in the development of the students' rural communities. With an enrollment of approximately 950, students can choose from a number of fields of study including Altiplano agronomy, food engineering, textile engineering, and veterinary sciences.
Located in the community of Cuyahuani near Lake Titicaca, the university continues to experience growth with the construction of new classrooms and facilities for the students.
Students live on campus on full scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and other related costs.
However, competition is high, and prospective students must take an entrance exam.
One of the requirements is that the student must speak the Aymara language because most of the classes are taught in that language. Many rural communities also provide their endorsement of the applying and accepted students, establishing this mutual commitment.
Mabel Franco, coordinator of the project La Pública, describes the average profile of the students and why this type of university is needed: The stories of the students have much in common: from homes living in extreme poverty, school years completed with great sacrifice, and frustration when it comes time to look for admission to a university.
The traditional professional formation system leaves many of these Bolivians marginalized, attended only by schools outside of a rural reality.
It is proven by the low rates of acceptance through admission exams: only 11 of 260 obtained the scholarship this way (in comparison to the pre-university courses which had an 80% success rate).

A new partnership between the Unibol, La Pública, and Jaqi Aru (a local organization that promotes the use of the Aymara language on the Internet) has launched a citizen journalism project to hear the voices of these students, who want to share their stories.
Through hands-on workshops, the students are learning how to express themselves and publish their stories on the website of La Pública.
While many students who speak Aymara are still hesitant to write in the language, some are attempting with the help of the Jaqi Aru team.
Many of the blog posts are written in Spanish and then translated into Aymara.
In future posts, we'll feature some of the blog posts that were first written in Aymara, and then translated into Spanish.
Here are some of the first blog posts from the Aymara Voices project, which seeks to collect "the social, environmental, socio-cultural, technological, educational experiences and express the daily lives of the students and of the communities."
The road leading to the university has not always been easy, but for agronomy student Delia Mamani Callisaya, after some challenges she now feels at home.
She describes the first informational meeting in 2010, where she along with 63 new classmates started to learn about the university and its opportunities.
Originally from the community of Guaqui, she describes these feelings:
I feel proud to be a part of this institution, which has grown more than many of us could have ever imagined.
I believe that my university is different than other universities across the country, without disparaging other universities.
For example, the friendship that unites the students is sincere, it is more than friendship, it is a brotherhood and sisterhood.
We are together everyday, getting to know one another and helping one another like a family. If a classmate is ill or is struggling with a class, we support one another so that they do not get discouraged so that they can move forward with the studies. The on-campus living allows us to maintain the values that I think are being lost among the youth.
Abidan Triguero Calle's journey to the university was also long, but worth the effort.
Originally from a community in the Altiplano, he started studying in La Paz. He looked at educational options in the city of Cochabamba, but the cost of the private university was prohibitive.
He then heard about the opportunity at the Unibol and it was exactly what he was looking for.
He is now studying food engineering, which will help his community.
He writes about his first semester with the Unibol and how it changed his outlook towards his future:
Honestly, I just came to see what this place was like. I stayed for the first semester and took classes such as Aymara cosmovision and now I can say that I identify more with the place where I was born.
I am Aymara born in the Ingavi province, Jesús de Machaca municipality, the community of Lahuacollo.
This university changed my way of thinking, and now I feel very committed to Bolivia.
"After Tsunami at Haramachi, Minami-soma, Fukushima, Japan."

March 11 marked the fourth anniversary of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.
Nearly 20,000 people died as a result of the massive temblor and resulting tidal wave, and nearly 230,000 people were forced to relocate.
A Japanese blogger, Takayoshi Saito, has described in detail how the disaster affected the life of his youngest sister and her family.
They used to live near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that itself became the scene of yet another large scale disaster following the earthquake and tsunami.
The following post was translated and republished on Global Voices with permission from the author.
'My Sister Built a New House With the TEPCO Settlement, Soma City is Building a New Municipal Hall'
Soma City in Fukushima Prefecture is my home town.
My youngest sister and her family used to live very close to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the township of Okuma.
Her husband used to work at Fukushima Daiichi as an employee at a security company, a TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc.) subsidiary in charge of facility management.
Four years ago, on March 11, 2011, the situation at Fukushima Daiichi got so frantic that no one cared about the security of the facilities anymore. So my youngest sister and her husband decided to evacuate from Okuma town with their 1-year-old daughter. I was in Tokyo, and had no luck when I tried to call my sister and my parents in Soma City.
I worried about them so much, but there was nothing I could do so I killed time by tweeting stuff like "Ohhhhhhhh, the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan is comiiiiiiiing!!!!" Only once I was able to talk with my parents in Soma over the phone.
They gave me an update saying, "Our house is fine.
Your youngest sister and her family have evacuated to Tamura City in Fukushima prefecture.
Your sister's father-in-law is staying in Okuma because he is a volunteer firefighter. "
After this conversation, I watched TV and learned the evacuation zone had been expanded and Tamura was now included in it.
Then I lost the whereabouts of my sister and her family.
I worried if they could evacuate from Tamura, but I couldn't get hold of her.
The only thing I could do was browse the Internet.
When I was browsing online, I discovered that the first relief supplies to arrive in Soma were coffins. Soma Girls' High School, which I had been so keen to attend when I was a high school student, had become a temporary morgue.
Many unidentified bodies were brought there from the coast, which had been hit hard by the giant tsunami.
The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) had also arrived in Soma and had started rescue operations.
Around the same time, my middle sister who lived in Urawa city in Saitama Prefecture (just to the north of Tokyo) asked her police officer boyfriend to drive up north to look for our youngest sister.
They found our sister and her family among other evacuees in Kita Ibaraki city (just down the coast from Soma and Okuma).
They put them in the car and drove back to Urawa city.
Meanwhile, I was just surfing the internet.
I was such a useless brother in that time of emergency.
I couldn't be of much help, but thought they would probably need cash.
So I withdrew money from Mizuho Bank, which had also been temporarily knocked offline by the sheer number of people trying to make donations to help people affected by the disaster.
I went to Urawa with the money and handed it to my sisters.
Urawa was at that time experiencing planned, rolling blackouts in order to conserve power from the weakened electricity grid, and my sisters seemed to have experienced a few blackouts.
When I gave them the money, my youngest sister said: "I'm so happy that everyone was okay", then cried.
My youngest sister and her family stayed in Urawa for about a month before returning to Soma, where they were able to move in to one of the temporary housing allocations.
When I visited Soma about one year later I saw my sister's temporary housing.
It was a wooden house that was clearly built in a hurried manner; the wood at the bottom had already started to rot.
I brought an Anpanman (a popular Japanese animation character) toy for my niece, but I couldn't help feeling pity for them.
Four years have passed since then.
My youngest sister's family made lots of savings thanks to the compensation money from TEPCO, and they built a new house in Soma.
A little one was born during this time, and they now have two daughters.
My sister's family told me that they were receiving a good amount of monetary compensation from TEPCO because the company pays even to small children, and my sister's family was therefore receiving compensation for four people.
They are in good financial shape.
My relatives in the area do not hate TEPCO as much as TV reports.
In Soma city, construction work has begun on a new city hall. The design for this new hall was inspired by a Japanese traditional storehouse style called "Kura-zukuri".
The old city hall, however, wasn't damaged by tsunami, and I wonder if there is a surplus in the budget for recovery that they'd rather spend somehow.
I also went to see the coastal area, but the little town where I used to see many guesthouses had turned into a vacant lot.
Some of the buildings were left damaged.
Soma used to be famous for seaweed cultivation, but it seemed too early to resume the business.
My mother lives in Soma.
One time she was listening to a traditional Japanese popular song called Matsukawaura Ohashi Ondo (The Dance of the Matsukawaura Bridge) when she was driving.
It has been four years since the earthquake.

I took this photo after the earthquake.
Follow-up
Last month, I visited Soma to tell my family about my latest move to a new condominium.
I wished I could have returned to my hometown as someone who had accomplished a great thing.
I told my parents: "I couldn't come here because I didn't have any good news."
They said: "It's your home. You can come back anytime." I will try again, ever harder, I promise.

The story of a three-year old girl, who left her home in the Peruvian city of Huancayo, had a happy ending thanks to Perla, her faithful pet. Persistent dog barking drew the attention of two police officers to a little girl crying on the sidewalk.
Ángel Quispe, one of the two policemen, approached her as he suspected the girl was lost.
Perla's first reaction was to attack the officer, but Quispe managed to pet the dog and ask the little girl where she lived.
The girl was unable to say her name, so the policeman took her hand and started asking around to find out if anyone knew who the girl was, but to no avail.
During their walk, Perla played guide by running ahead of them, and after passing eight blocks, the dog suddenly sat down at the door of a house, that turned out to be the girl's family home.
SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY!
Huancayo: Dogs tried to prevent the dead body of their owner to be taken to the morgue.
More than 50 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in the Himalayan country and neighbouring states, as many buildings already weakened by a much bigger quake last month were brought down.

Just as Nepal was coming back to normalcy following a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that devastated the country on April 25, a second quake of 7.3 magnitude hit the country again on May 12.
Journalist Narendra Raule tweeted:
Many people in the street.
Big earthquake in # Nepal. # EarthquakeAgain # Nepal # NepalQuake — Narendra Raule (@ NRaule) May 12, 2015
This time it was a weekday.
On April 25, it was Saturday and people were in their homes.
But on May 12, most were in their workplaces. There was a mayhem of traffic on the streets after the earthquake.
More than 8,000 people were killed in the April 25 temblor.
Fifty-seven deaths have been reported so far in this quake, with more than a thousand injured.
Dolakha district has been hit hard, with 34 reported deaths and 90 per cent houses collapsed, as per the preliminary information collected by Nepal Police.

Couldn't dare to stay inside!
Popular online portal Onlinekhabar posted a photo story on the plight of people spending the night under the open skies.
Last week, the government of Nepal had requested that foreign relief and rescue workers return back to their countries as the situation was normalizing and the rest could be handled by the government itself.
With teams from many countries already going home, the rescue and relief will be a tough task.
# Nepal jumped the gun by sending home foreign help.
Schools which were to open this week have been further shut down for two weeks more.
They will now open beginning May 30, as per the directive issued by the Ministry of Education.
Nepalis had started getting back to their normal lives, recovering and rebuilding, but are again living in fear after the second quake.
Kashish Das Shrestha tweeted:
Yohandra (seated) and Gerson are of the few left who hold on to the memories of the Pinar del Río Sanitarium in Cuba.
Both were able to salvage the medical files of several patients who passed away there, many of whom were their friends.
Photo: Radio Ambulante.
In Cuba, Gerson and Yohandra are known as "freaks" (frikis in Spanish), a group devoted to 1980s and 90s rock and heavy metal.
Rock music is more than just entertainment to "freaks"; it is a lifestyle, like a religion.
Gerson and Yohandra are one of the few left of their generation.
They live in the Cuban province Pinar del Río, where there once stood a sanitarium whose mission was to prevent the spread of the HIV / AIDS epidemic during the 80s and 90s.
Ruins, the medical files they managed to save, and their memories are all that remain.
And with this we kickoff the new collaboration between Global Voices and Radio Ambulante, a producer of radio stories from any country where there is a Spanish-speaking population, including the United States.
Global Voices author and Radio Ambulante reporter Luis Trelles (@ cu _ bata) brings us "The Survivors", a story about the "freaks" from the Pinar del Río Sanitarium.
During the Special Period in Cuba, many "freaks" infected themselves with AIDS in order to have what they thought to be better living conditions:
Gerson: Before living on the street, people preferred to be sick and come here to have everything — and for free – which was a most influential factor: it was free, a gift.
However, the lack of knowledge about AIDS during that time took many peoples' lives:
Narrator: But there was so little information about the virus.
People didn't speak openly about the epidemic yet, nor the ways in which it was transmitted.
Almost all of the "freaks" who injected themselves were men; they didn't know they could infect others through sexual contact. Listen to the complete story in Spanish here:

May 21 marks the National Day of Cultural and Linguistic Diverisity, and to commemorate the occasion, the Peruvian National Registrar of Identification and Civil Status (Reniec) launched the Awajun-Spanish bilingual civil registrar:
The documents thus generated will have the same official validity as the documents in Spanish, and the authenticated copies will be available in any agency or at the Virtual Multiservices Platform of Reniec.
The Awajún are an ethnic group from the Peruvian Amazon region. Their language has 70,000 Peruvian speakers in the departments of Amazonas, Cajamarca, Loreto and San Martín.
On Twitter, users shared remarks and pictures of this new registrar:
The following tribute to the late Espíritu Bautista was written by Anna Luisa Daigneault, Latin America Projects Coordinator at Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages on her Facebook profile.
It is republished here with permission.
Bautista participated in the Enduring Voices: Digital Media Workshop for Speakers of Endangered Languages in Latin America held in Santiago, Chile, in early 2013, in which Rising Voices also took part. There, he actively worked with his son to revitalize the Yanesha language through the production of the Yanesha Talking Dictionary.
The above video shows some of this work.
My friend and colleague Espíritu Bautista passed away several weeks ago. He was a very charismatic and wise person, and he will be missed by his community, the indigenous Yanesha people of the southcentral Amazon in Peru, and he will be missed by everyone who got a chance to work with him.
Espíritu was one of the last people in his tribe who had in-depth, detailed knowledge about all of the ancient Yanesha music and oral history.
Espíritu Bautista.
Photo by Anna Lazuli
I had the immense privilege of working with Espíritu every year in Peru between 2008 - 2013 and help build the Yanesha Oral History Archives, a digital project that catalogued over 300 hours of traditional music and stories, recorded by Espíritu Bautista and Richard Chase Smith.
Espíritu loved eating fish (he would sometimes remark, "my people prefer to not eat birds") and always had helpful advice to offer, and intriguing stories to tell.
He would describe Yanesha music and stories in a vivid, meaningful way.
Here are a few excerpts from his catalog (in Spanish, with English translations below) so you can learn a little bit about Yanesha heritage:
Mellañotheñrexh - Song of the Mountain Gods | This song originates from the gods who reside within nature.
When we concentrate and focus on good things, they are always compassionate towards us.
Rrartsorexh - Yucca's Song | This song originates from Our Mother Yucca (aka cassava root).
We sing this song when we plant yucca so that high-quality yuccas will grow.
Yachor Pallá - Our Mother Pallá | This is the story of Our Mother Pallá, wife of the Inca.
She brought us cotton, which was woven by Our Sister Spider Woman, so that we could have our traditional robes, the cushma.
Espiritu's work is preserved in the Yanesha Oral History Archives.
HRH Rilwan Akiolu, Oba of Lagos (June 2, 2006).
U.S. Navy photo by Journalist 1st Class Kurt Riggs released to Wikimedia Commons
His Royal Highness Oba Rilwan Babatunde Osuolale Aremu Akiolu I, the Oba (King) of Lagos has made a royal gaffe.
At a meeting of Igbo leaders in the state, he recently threatened that any Igbo person that does not vote for Akinwumi Ambode (governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress) will "perish inside water":
On Saturday, if anyone of you, I swear in the name of God, goes against my wish that Ambode will be the next governor of Lagos State, the person is going to die inside this water.
I ’ m not ready to beg you.
Nobody knew how I picked Ambode.
Jimi (Agbaje) is my blood relation and I told him that he cannot be governor in Lagos for now.
The future belongs to God.
I am not begging anybody, but what you people cannot do in Onitsha, Aba or anywhere, don ’ t do it here. If you do what I want, Lagos will continue to be prosperous for you.
If you go against my wish, you will perish in the water.
Here is an audio of the said speech shared on Twitter:
Although Nigeria runs a presidential system, it still retains monarchs of the various ethnic groups that make up the country.
The traditional rulers no longer exercise sovereignty but only ceremonial powers.
However, they remain a potent moral force with grassroots validity among their subjects.
Nigerians will vote for state governors this weekend.
The two major contenders for Lagos State governorship slot are Akinwumi Ambode of the APC (All Progressive Congress) and Jimi Agbaje of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The presidential elections, which were held on March 28, saw General Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressive Congress (APC) defeating the incumbent, Dr Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Though peaceful, the elections were, however, marked with ethnocentric political alignments with the South-East and South-South voting for President Jonathan, while most parts of North and South-West voted for General Buhari.
These ethnic fault lines might play out in next Saturday elections.
The Igbos of South-Eastern Nigeria gave block votes to President Goodluck Jonathan.
Netizens were naturally furious about the Oba of Lagos' "hate speech" and threat.
Chxta said it was a call to unleash genocide on the Igbos:
I have thought about it.
This is the fact: three national papers, This Day, Independent & PM News quoted him.
Oba Akiolu threatened genocide — Chxta of Greece (@ Chxta) April 6, 2015
The Chairman of Nigeria Human Rights Commission thought that:

Kabiyesi just made @ realFFK and Dame Peshe look like learners!
Apologies again to all Ndigbo on TL. — Adekunle (@ kunleadefioye) April 6, 2015
Writer Tunde Leye requested that the Lagos State governor, Tunde Fashola, sanction the Oba: Your party wrote the ICC about Patience Jonathan's hate speech. I trust you will act on Oba Akiolu's hate speech @ tundefashola — Tunde Leye (@ tundeleye) April 6, 2015
The Oba should go, tweeted Foghi Batarhe:
I won't even bother to share that audio file.
That Oba Akiolu should be deposed. Straight.
He was even swearing by Allah. — Foghi Batarhe (@ Batarhe) April 6, 2015
Nze Slyva decried the ethnocentric sentiments that had characterized the election season:
I see anti Igbo sentiments everywhere.
From the Oba who 'owns' Lagos to Mr Afolayan whose work I happen to admire a lot. Dalu nu o! — Sylva Nze Ifedigbo (@ nzesylva) April 6, 2015
However, not all were in support:
If I were an Igbo leader, I would tell my kinsmen it is in our enlightened self interest to align with the Oba.
Obinze lampooned those defending the Oba:
The idiots who were defending the Oba with their fathers grave that he didn't make those comments have gone silent.
Typically, some Twitter users made jokes out of the discussion.
I just called my Uncle whose siblings where inside Oba Akiolu's mouth while he was speaking.
HE DID NOT say that.

Global Voices Image from the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran Facebook page.
Global Voices is now hosting research and commentary published by the New York-based human rights watchdog, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.
We are committed to telling all sides of the story inside Iran, and human rights concerns are a big part of understanding the country.
The Campaign has consistently provided in-depth reportage and analysis on a broad array of issues concerning Iranians.
Their meticulous research and documentation and informed advocacy for human rights has garnered them a reputation of impartiality and reliability along with much international trust and respect.
The Campaign was founded in 2008 as a non-partisan, non-profit, independent human rights organisation.
Global Voices has relied on the Campaign ’ s reportage and team of experts when covering major human rights concerns, so we enthusiastically welcome this new collaboration to enrich our Iran page.
“Global Voices shines a spotlight on those who strive for justice and equality worldwide, ” said Hadi Ghaemi, Executive Director of the Campaign.
“We are very pleased to be able to add to this unique platform the voices of those who are struggling for their rights inside Iran. ”
We encourage our readers to visit the Campaign ’ s website, www.iranhumanrights.org, and read more about the work they are doing protecting and promoting basic rights and freedoms in Iran.

Don Osborne discusses a news feature on the Olivet Nazarene University website showing a map of "The Second Most Spoken Languages Around the World."
He points out key problems from the map:
The first issue is assuming that "The most spoken language in any country is often obvious; usually, it ’ s the official language of the country."
In Africa this often is not the case, if by "most spoken" one counts number of speakers. An example is Mali, whose linguistic profile was explored on this blog in discussing the long-tail of languages - Bambara is certainly more used than the official French.
Official language is a category that doesn't lend itself to ranking use of languages in Africa, beyond the (admittedly important) context of official use and its spillover to popular use.
In the case of two countries at least, this runs into additional problems: • South Africa has 11 official languages (the Olivet site incorrectly lists only one of them - Zulu - as official).
So one of the official languages will be second most spoken.
Perhaps that is Xhosa as indicated, but the model focusing on official languages hasn't worked here.
• Rwanda has three official languages (Kinyarwanda, French, and English), and Central African Republic two (Sango and French).
Since the site doesn't consider these official languages in discussing second most widely spoken, it is reduced to stating that Swahili is "second" most used in Rwanda, and that indigenous languages are used in CAR - which doesn't tell us much.

They report:
The vast majority (84%) of the children left behind in cars were between the ages of 0 and 4.
The kids were most commonly left in private vehicles (84%), but they were also forgotten on school buses, public buses, and even Jerusalem ’ s light rail.

Since being posted on Wednesday, May 27, 2015 on Chef Cohen's Facebook page, the video has been viewed by over 145,000 people, liked 3,000 times and shared 4,000 times, with more than 200 comments.
The post is simply captioned:
"That's right! In the car!
It's simple, it's easy, and it's hot. "
He begins by preparing a pizza, placing the dough on a cooking sheet, spreading the sauce, and adding the toppings: cheese, corn, olives, mushroom and cheese.
Then he places the pizza in a car, telling the audience, "Thirty minutes in the car.
Then we'll check. "
When he opens the car after 30 minutes, the pizza is burned from crust to core.
The video concludes:
Dear friends: in the summer, the car is exactly like an oven.
Don't leave a child alone in a car, not even for a single minute! Every summer there is a sharp rise in accidents involving children.
Share this video and prevent the next tragedy.
Here is the full one-minute video, in Hebrew with English subtitles:
Hat tip: Times of Israel.
An invitation to a forum for the premiere of the Sarayaku videos.
While the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled in 2012 in favor of the Sarayaku community, stating that the Ecuadorian government must consult with affected communities before signing exploration or drilling contracts, the people of Sarayaku still face ongoing pressures.
As a way to continue to explore the various uses of participatory video tools, the Sarayaku community partnered with El Churo Collective to train young people from the community as well as other surrounding indigenous communities to learn how to create digital videos that capture their realities and to reaffirm their commitment to preserving their natural surroundings.
The project was a Rising Voices grantee in 2014 as part of the Rising Voices Amazonia initiative.
In this first video from this project, the narrator speaks in the Kichwa language stating the importance of water for the Sarayaku people.
Through the use of the Amara subtitling platform, the video is now available with English subtitles and open for others to add subtitles in other languages.
These videos premiered at various events in Quito and Sarayaku, followed by discussions and debates regarding the topics raised in them.
We'll be featuring more of the videos from the project over the next few weeks.
With about 17 active editors (also known as “uikiali ”) spread across various parts of India and abroad, and over 8,800 articles, the project has become more than just an encyclopedia.
The voluntary editor community has put its efforts into acquiring valuable Creative Commons (CC) licensed content by lobbying copyright holders / authors to relicense copyrighted content under CC licenses.
It has also engaged with over 2,000 people by organizing various outreach programs including the globally accredited pedagogic program the Wikipedia Education Program (WEP).
Unique page views of Odia Wikipedia (2008-2015).
Odia language is spoken by more than 40 million people in the Indian state of Odisha (the 9th largest Indian state by territory), its neighboring states and the Odia diaspora living outside India.
With over 5,000 years of literary heritage, it has been recognized as one of the oldest South Asian languages and has been given the status of a “classical language ” by the Indian government.
However, the language has not gathered as much traction in terms of online presence as it might have.
Almost all the online newspapers in Odia are available either in non-Unicode and proprietary encoding systems, or as images.
This makes them completely invisible as far as a search engine is concerned.
The same goes for the state government's official portals that either lack Odia-language content or have content in legacy encoding systems.
To address these issues, a bunch of character encoding converters that convert text typed using various non-Unicode encoding systems to Unicode are incorporated on Odia Wikipedia.
Odia Wikipedia was not content-rich until the beginning of 2011, when editor activity began to pick up.
Since then it has expanded its content massively, with topics ranging from the essentials of medical science to the cuisine of Odisha.
The growth in readership of the project is a great example of how content is driving the internet.
A project that was virtually unknown a few years back with monthly page views in the low thousands recorded 8,08,834 page views in March 2015 alone. The Wikimedia community is gathering in Odisha's capital Bhubaneswar this June 3 to celebrate Odia Wikipedia becoming a teenager.
Event details: https: / / or.wikipedia.org / s / sml * Wikipedia and many other portals support and promote Unicode, a globally accepted standard for character encoding that enables uniformity and no loss of information across platforms, as it is the best encoding for accessibility, content search and reuse.
"Silence about rape means it will continue." Image from Russian online community against rape.
VKontakte.
Official figures say a fifth of women in Russia have experienced domestic violence.
If you include cases of verbal abuse, the figure jumps to 40 percent.
Only 12 percent of women, however, ever turn to the police for help.
As if these numbers aren ’ t disturbing enough, the explosion of online social networks in Russia makes it easier than ever for sexual predators to contact and track down women. But the Internet also presents women with new weapons against their attackers that can challenge a legal system stacked against them.
This is the story of one such case, reported by the Russian news network TV Rain, about a 24-year-old woman in Moscow who says she was raped by a man she met online.
The Internet has also played a crucial role in her efforts to get justice.
Yulia says she got acquainted with her attacker on the Internet, and they agreed to meet for coffee at her apartment.
When they spoke beforehand on the phone, the man was apparently courteous and kind.
Their date started off well enough; he introduced himself as a police officer (a member of the SWAT, no less), even proving it to Yulia by showing her his badge and passport.
They chatted for a few hours and watched a movie.
The man even fell asleep during the film.
When Yulia woke him up, he raped her.
This was on April 21, she says.
Yulia didn ’ t go to the police immediately.
Later that night, after her attacker had gone home, she called him on the phone and demanded an explanation.
He responded calmly, she says, telling her it wasn ’ t a “big deal. ” When Yulia said she would file a police report, the man told her she ’ d never prove his guilt.
The next morning, he showed up at Yulia ’ s doorstep, ostensibly to apologize.
Yulia says he started yelling at her, instead.
When she slapped him in the face to stop his screaming, he beat her up.
Afterwards, a doctor at a first aid clinic would tell her that she suffered a concussion.
(TV Rain says it has a copy of the doctor ’ s diagnosis.)
After the fight, he called the police, claiming Yulia attacked him without provocation.
Yulia called the police, too, but the same unit responded to both calls. The couple was brought into a local police station, where officers repeatedly reminded Yulia that false accusations are a crime punishable by as many as three years in prison.
She filed a report, but says she soon saw her attacked walk out of the station with the document in hand.
Witnessing this, Yulia abandoned her efforts and went home.
After consulting with a friend who worked in law enforcement, Yulia appealed to Russia ’ s Investigative Committee, where she was reminded again of the penalties for false accusations.
After a delay of a few days, investigators questioned her and later came to her apartment to seize evidence.
They promised to contact Yulia with an update by May 5.
Before May 5, Yulia ’ s attacker returned to her home several times.
He apologized, she says, and begged her to drop the charges.
When Yulia went to meet with her lawyer for the first time, her attacker was waiting outside her apartment that morning. He pressured her into letting him come with her to the meeting.
Yulia paid the attorney for the consultation and handed over the forensic-medical evidence for her case.
The lawyer, who decided not to take Yulia as a client, later refused to return these documents. When her next lawyer failed to retrieve the paperwork, she threatened to press charges.
It lasted nearly eight hours. Yulia ’ s second lawyer was unhappy with her decision to bring friends and supporters to the investigators ’ office, saying publicity wouldn ’ t help her case.
Yulia later said she thought it “strange ” that her own legal representative feared publicity.
Yulia ’ s third and current lawyer is Mari Davtyan, an attorney at the Bar Association Moscow Legal Center and an expert on the Kremlin ’ s Social Commission of the Human Rights Council.
For years, Davtyan has worked on domestic violence and campaigned against women ’ s discrimination on the labor market.
She says she learned about Yulia ’ s story the same place that it started: an online social network.
“In my experience, ” Davtyan told TV Rain,“ frighten everyone with penalties for false accusations — even those who are beaten in their own homes.
But in my experience, nobody actually files these charges, and I ’ ve yet to meet a woman who was lying. ”
Davtyan says they should know by early June if investigators intend to open a case against Yulia ’ s attacker.
Yulia says she intends to appeal, if police refuse to press on.
In a VKontakte post that ’ s been shared in several online communities dedicated to confronting violence against women, Yulia vows to keep fighting.
Raising awareness about her story in online social networks, she argues, will engage the press and subject the authorities to a higher level of public scrutiny, hopefully pressuring police into charging the man who she says raped her.
My new lawyer is a woman who has advised attracting the public ’ s attention, insofar as police won ’ t be able to drop the case after the media gets involved, and those who are guilty and responsible for the coverup will be punished.
So I ’ m asking for any help you can manage to tell others about this outrageous case.
I ’ m simply tired of being afraid, and my own personal reputation is already destroyed.
Thank you.
That ’ s why I ’ m asking for your help.
Thank you.
TV Rain spoke on the phone to the man Yulia says raped her.
Refusing to say where he works exactly, the man confirmed that he is employed by the police, and denied sexually assaulting Yulia, who he says is mentally ill.
He says his supervisors are aware of the allegations against him, and he ’ s confident that he ’ ll be vindicated.
He also promises to press charges against Yulia for what he says are false criminal accusations.
Though Yulia has said online that she seeks publicity for her case, RuNet Echo is declining to publish her surname, following TV Rain ’ s decision to withhold this information.
Yulia did not respond to our requests for additional comment.

However, schools resumed after one month, defying the threats.
Now, one school in particular is spreading hope among the unease.
The Peshawar School for Peace, which was officially inaugurated on 6 May 2015, aims to promote interfaith harmony, girls' education and social cohesion.
It was founded by an Australian social justice activist, Francis Ventura, in collaboration of the Peshawar Youth Organisation.
Men and women belonging to all religious communities work under one banner:
Learning in unity today, leading in harmony tomorrow.
Watch an introductory video posted to the organisation's YouTube channel below:
Global Voices spoke with Ventura as well as Maryum Daniyal and Aleina Ali Shah, who work on the project, about their aims, achievements and experiences with the school.
Global Voices (GV): After the traumatic events of December 2014, was it difficult to launch a school that promotes interfaith harmony and girls' education?
Francis Ventura (FV): The Army Public School massacre sent shockwaves through the entire world. It is a well-known fact that many youth in Peshawar are still suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. So in this long-standing context of extremist threat – particularly after the APS attack – our determination is strengthened and the need for a youth-led peace movement is made more urgent.
We stand firmly on the side of humanity. We will always continue with our work in the face of pure evil, because so long as any child anywhere in the world is suffering due to poverty or conflict, all of humanity is weakened as a result.
Mariyum Daniyal and Aleina Ali Shah (MD & AAS): After the heartbreaking event of 16th December, 2014 it was quite challenging for us to practically launch a Peace School in Peshawar.
It isn't easy to work on interfaith harmony and girls ’ empowerment especially in Peshawar but so far we have achieved good results, and we are looking forward to spreading this message of Peace throughout Pakistan.
GV: The curriculum is designed to promote religious tolerance. Is this challenging, given that Peshawar is considered to be a conservative place?
MD & AAS: Everything; starting from the launch to convincing people on trusting us with a peace-oriented curriculum, was a big challenge, thankfully people have shown their trust in us.
The society understands how important it is to build a peace-promoting generation now.
FV: The beauty of what we teach is that it is embraced by the local community.
At our inauguration ceremony, we had scholars and community leaders from the Islamic, Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities all publicly speaking about the need to enhance respect among people of different faiths, as well as celebrating commonalities.
They also specifically endorsed the Peshawar School for Peace as a model to achieve this.
Most importantly, the feedback from parents has been overwhelmingly positive.
We promote education for all - before anything else, we are all humans so we just love and appreciate each other.
The inauguration of The Peshawar School for Peace, 6 May 2015.
Francis Ventura, cuts the ribbon along with people of all religious communities.

GV: Has the school been threatened by extremists?
FV: As a matter of protocol, we are unable to publicly discuss specific security matters pertaining to the School.
However as individuals, we understand that there are those driven by evil, and we are aware of their actions elsewhere.
The team is driven by an unflinching passion to build a better future for the children of Pakistan, and nothing will cause that desire to waver.
GV: What is the school's main goal?
FV: Our main goal is to achieve peace in Pakistan. We aim to achieve this through education, based on two critical pillars of development – social cohesion and girls ’ empowerment.
Additionally, we aim to bring the people of Australia and Pakistan together, the School has already held its first Skype call with a class in Australia, as well as encouraging our students to become global citizens, ready to serve humanity for the better and be ambassadors for peace.
GV: The project aims to build a relationship between Australian and Pakistani youth.
Will this promote healthy relations on diplomatic level?
FV: You are correct – we are strengthening the citizen-to-citizen links between Pakistan and Australia.
We hope that as a result of the growing links between our countries, diplomatic relations will also expand.
Fortunately, Australia and Pakistan already enjoy a very robust friendship.
There are regular visits between our countries by senior military personnel, government ministers and business delegations.
There are thousands of young Pakistanis working and studying in Australia.
In addition, we enjoy strong support from the Pakistani Consul-General in Sydney as well as the Australian High Commission in Islamabad.
After the APS massacre, over 1,000 people came together for a vigil in Sydney ’ s Hyde Park to remember the victims and stand in solidarity with Peshawar. When Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was killed in an accident, candles were lit across Pakistan. This project gives me an opportunity to combine my love for Australia and Pakistan and bring people of each country together.
GV: As a foreigner, what do you think about Peshawar?
FV: Peshawar is my second home.
I love everything about it.
The incredible culture, rich in tradition and history.
The warmth and generosity of its people. Their beautiful smiles.
My heart is warmed every time I visit this magnificent place.
People are always fascinated by meeting someone from a foreign land.
As an Australian, conversations generally turn to cricket.
I look forward to the day when delegations of Australian students can have the opportunity to visit Peshawar and experience the pleasures it has to offer.
GV: As women, what is your experience like working in Peshawar?
MD & AAS: Working in Peshawar on a peace project and also being women is not an easy thing to do, we face hardships and difficulties in everyday life, but that doesn't discourage us.
What we think is that when you really want to do something, nothing can stop you.
GV: Tell us about the school's progress.
FV: It ’ s been about one year and a half since my first Skype conversation with the Peshawar Youth Organization, which became the inception of the project.
We started with nothing – no money or contacts – just a dream.
In that time, we have built a coalition of Partners for Peace across the world, including various United Nations bodies, the Malala Fund, businesses such as NetSol Technologies, Sunrise Marketing and Mark Industries, as well as religious and community groups such as the Australian National Dialogue of Christians, Muslims and Jews – the interfaith body of the respective religions ’ peak representative bodies.
Nowadays, we have an operational School, inclusive of pre-nursery and class one, as well as the Community Engagement Center. Close to 30% of our students are from the various minority communities, and a majority of the children are girls. Given that harmony between different faiths is severely lacking and that only 35% of girls in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region are literate, this is a significant achievement.
We are looking forward to growing and spreading the message of peace and a common humanity throughout Pakistan and the entire globe.
GV: What message do you want to give the world?
FV: We cannot allow the future of humanity to be lost to those who represent evil and seek to impose it through violence and division.
A better world is possible; we just have to strive for it.
Everyone who believes in justice, peace and a common humanity must continue to strive for this. Social cohesion, while a beautiful phenomenon, is delicate and must be nurtured.
The attacks on the All Saints Church and Army Public School – as well as countless others – are examples of a situation in which evil prevails.
We invite all loving, good natured citizens of the world to stand with us.
Become part of the movement for peace, which is already made up of people from many religious, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
We can only do this with your support.
It is not the cause of any particular individual or organization – it is the cause of all humanity.
Our Facebook page provides regular updates of the project and anyone is welcome to get in contact with us to pledge their support.
Together, and only together, we can and will achieve a better world.
The future of humanity depends on it.
Bangladesh welcomes a monsoon after a scorching heat wave.

Somewhere there was someone knee-deep in water, somewhere a car had broken down in the middle of the road because of engine failure, and somewhere traffic congestion had become a nightmare for the city dwellers.
This was how Bangladesh welcomed the beginning of the monsoon season this year as heavy rain saw drainpipes block and streets turn into rivers. With the country's summer drawing to a close, a number of heat waves had made life unbearable, leading Facebook users to post about the soaring temperatures on their timelines.
Then the monsoon season hit and scorching hot became soaking wet.
Tension gave way to relief. Bangladesh is a land of six seasons.
Barsha (rainy) is one of them.
Some 80% of the country's total annual rainfall occurs during Barsha.
People welcomed the monsoon on social media, while criticising drainage facilities in Dhaka, the 11th most populous city in the world with almost 17 million people according to a 2014 UN report.
Journalist Probhash Amin wrote:
I love rain.
I like to walk in the wet morning especially where it is green.
I know rain makes our regular life difficult.
This morning I also faced troubles when I was taking my son Proshun to school. Students and office goers suffer most from the morning rain.
For those people that live under the open skies, there is no end to their suffering.
Activist Akku Chowdhury wrote on Facebook:
What a beautiful monsoon day to start the morning with! Walked to work in the rain as the avenue is blocked for rain and the PM's visit!
The advent of the monsoon always produces vivid images:

As the world celebrates World Sickle Cell Day on June 19, awareness of the disease remains low among a large portion of the Tharu indigenous people in Nepal, though many have lost their lives to it.
Pramod Neupane, a civil engineer, tweeted:
Sickle Cell disease in Tharu Communities is an inherited genetic disorder.
Tharus, the fourth largest group in terms of population in Nepal, have a seven-fold lower prevalence of malaria than non-Tharus.
Tharus have been living in the plains, which were infested with malaria for thousands of years.
Sickle cell has been found to be more prevalent in the malaria-affected areas, and the people with sickle-cell trait have been found to be more resistant to malaria.
Twitter profile Genetics and Beyond tweeted:
With the vast numbers of people diagnosed with sickle cell it is a surprise that not a lot of people are aware of it # SpeakOnSickleCellObama — SickleGirl (@ SickledGirl) June 12, 2015
Sickle-cell disease receives its name from the abnormally shaped red blood cells, like a sickle in appearance, that get stuck in the blood vessels.
The disorder, which is inherited from parents, makes it difficult for the blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the body, causing intense pain and leading to complications like organ damage and stroke at times.
As the diagnosis and treatment of the disease is very expensive and not available at local health facilities in Nepal, many families have sold their land and properties to get treatment in neighboring India.
Last year, the government of Nepal announced free treatment for sickle-cell anaemia patients.
However, the health facilities don ’ t have the necessary medical equipment and even for the diagnosis, blood samples are sent to India.
Awareness is crucial
Doctors say awareness is crucial to prevent sickle-cell disease.
It is not contagious and people are born with the disorder.
Since there is a 25 per cent chance that a child will have the disease if both parents carry the sickle-cell trait, it is advisable not to conduct marriage between people who share the trait.
Doctors have also advised the Tharu community to go for inter-caste marriages in the areas where the disease is prevalent to check the further spread.
Saving thousands of lives doesn't have to cost millions of dollars.
Two students in Africa recently demonstrated that it takes as little as 59 cents to keep some human beings alive, and the solution can be as simple as a bar of soap.
Moctar Dembele, a native of Burkina Faso, and Gerard Niyondiko, born in Burundi, are students at the International Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
Dembele and Niyondiko are no strangers to the threat of malaria, which is the leading cause of death in Subsaharan Africa.
Every year around the world, about 600,000 people die from malaria — a disease caused by parasites that are spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
The symptoms typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches.
To help counter the disease, Dembele and Niyondiko invented a soap made from locally sourced herbs and natural ingredients, like Shea butter and lemongrass oil, that repel disease-carrying mosquitoes.
They called it the "Faso soap ”.
The concept has the appeal of being both highly practical and affordable:
To help them with their initiative, UC Berkeley's Global Social Venture Competition recently awarded Dembélé and Niyondiko $26,500.
The science behind the idea is quite straightforward, explains Hugo Jalinière, a science reporter at Sciences et Avenir, a French science magazine:
The soap acts as a repellent in two ways: its smell and an inside component that kills the larvae and prevents their proliferation in still water.
The tests performed on a sample population in Ouagadougou turned out quite promising.
According to the World Health Organization, there are about 200 millions cases of malaria infections annually, resulting in roughly 660,000 deaths.
There is no vaccine yet against malaria, but a plethora of antimalarial medications are available as treatments for the various symptoms. Prevention measures are plenty, but there is no full-proof protection against parasite-carrying mosquitoes and repellents are part of the combination of preventive measures used in the region.
Scientists have extensively studied different plant-based repellents against mosquitoes.
Sarah Moore, a scientist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says the results of studies on such repellents' efficiency are so far are inconclusive, but their use has gained in popularity because of the rationale behind such measures:
The field of plant-based repellents is moving forward as consumers demand means of protection from arthropod bites that are safe, pleasant to use and environmentally sustainable.
It is also extremely fertile due to wealth of insecticidal compounds found in plants as defences against insects.
The modern pyrethroids that are the mainstay of the current malaria elimination program that is making excellent progress are harmless to mammals.
Screen Capture of Interactive Africa Map of Artemisinins data via WWARN
Dembélé and Niyondiko are also painfully aware of the economic obstacles to fighting malaria.
Niyondiko's home country, Burundi, is currently in the middle of a grave humanitarian crisis and the nation ranks 167th among 177 countries on the UN Human Development Index.
Burkina Faso went through its own political upheaval recently and about half of the population lives on less than 1.25 USD a day.
Any sustainable solutions to malaria in Africa must be especially affordable, given the region's history and ongoing struggles.
With this in mind, Dembélé and Niyondiko sought to design Faso soap to be as low cost as possible.
The project, moreover, could not come at a better time, as the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network recently warned health agencies that resistance to the antimalarial drug artemisinin is on the rise:
As of February 2015, artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in 5 countries In the large majority of sites, patients with artemisinin-resistant parasites still recover after treatment, provided that they are treated with an ACT containing an effective partner drug.
However, along the Cambodia-Thailand border, P. falciparum has become resistant to almost all available antimalarial medicines.
There is a real risk that multidrug resistance will soon emerge in other parts of the subregion as well.
Dembélé and Niyondiko know the road ahead is still long, but they say they are prepared for an extended fight.
Dembélé says the battle is about more than beating the disease; it's also about giving Africa brighter hopes for its own future.
After winning the award from UC Berkeley, he said:
I am very happy that this award is also a victory for Africa and particularly for Burkina Faso.
This is the first time a non-American team has won this award.
This award is to honor of all the youth of Africa.
We hope it will inspire others to move forward.

Evidence discovered on Fraser Island located in Queensland, Australia, suggests there may have been Aboriginal inhabitants as far back as 5,000 years ago.
The traditional owners of this land, the Butchulla people, called the island with its incredible natural surroundings K'gari meaning "paradise."
However, the Butchulla people faced hardships after the arrival of colonizers, who eventually displaced them from their land.
Fraser Island, QueenslandThe Butchulla language also suffered during this time, almost leading to its extinction in the 20th century due to governmental policies and missionary groups that prohibited it.
Thanks to present-day revitalization efforts by the Butchulla Language Program, the language is now returning.
The program has produced new resources such as dictionaries music CDs, and organized activities, such as language courses at local libraries, all of which is helping to encourage younger generations to take an interest in it.
Digital media and the Internet are also playing a role in these revitalization efforts. As part of the ABC Open project "Mother Tongue" in which local communities partner with video producers from the Australia Broadcasting Corporation to create participatory videos focusing on Aboriginal language revitalization.
One such video collaboration took place between Joyce Bonner, a community linguist with the Korrawinga Aboriginal Corporation in Hervey Bay area, and ABC Open producer Brad Marsellos.
Together they created this video sharing a traditional Butchulla lullaby sung by Bonner's own mother. Two little eyes to look up to God
The team also collaborated to produce another video teaching the Butchulla words for body parts: These videos are one part of the strategy to revitalize the Butchulla language.

News portal Greek Reporter and Anastassios Adamopoulos recently republished a story that first appeared at Turkish Hurriet Daily News online, focusing on a trend that has seen many Greek families escape the worsening economic crisis in Greece by returning to their homeland on the Turkish island of Gökçeada in Çanakkale Province, known in Greek as Imbros.
In the report, local Mayor Ünal Çetin congratulates Greeks for helping to boost the island's local economy, with several repatriated families starting up small boutique hotels to make a living.
Meanwhile, Turkish and Greek social media users have been coming together under the hashtags # Imvros and # Gokceada to celebrate the island's beauty.
Many Greek families, mostly descendants of ethnic Greeks born and raised on the island from antiquity until the mid-point of the 20th century, still spend their summers in Imbros.
These families subsequently emigrated to Greece due to a Turkish state-sponsored campaign of discrimination.
The fact that they are moving back despite less-than-perfect relations between Ankara and Athens says much about the scale of the catastrophe that has befallen Greece, as well as the strength of their bond with the island.
Moreover, while bad economic news continues to seep out of the country they left behind, the theme of their return to Gökçeada is one of gradual regeneration and homecoming:

The first house in Gaiman, Chubut, Argentina.

This industry was helping to fuel the growth of the Industrial Revolution, with the supply of coal, slate, iron and steel.
Many believed that Wales was now gradually being absorbed into England, and perhaps disillusioned with this prospect, or excited by the thought of a new start in a new world, many Welshmen and women decided to seek their fortune in other countries.
Usually, the arrival of Europeans on the American continent spelled trouble and violence, but this was somewhat different.
The Wales-Argentina Association sums up the history of this settlement:
For half a century after the Welsh migration, the foundations of what today are the cities of Puerto Madryn at Bahía Nueva, Rawson, Gaiman, Trelew to Dolavon in the Chubut river valley and Trevelin in Valle Hermoso (Cwm Hyfryd) in the Andes, were laid.
Many Welsh descendents also live in Esquel, at the foot of the Andes; in Comodoro Rivadavia, the biggest city in the province; in Colonia Sarmiento and all across the Republic.
The Welsh created a prosperous society, where the Welsh language enjoyed a privileged status. Wales is famous for its valleys, and as Crónicas del sur del mundo notes, it was similar territory in Patagonia that provided a new home for the settlers:
Gaiman is the first city founded by the 150 Welsh people who landed on the outskirts of what today is Puerto Madryn and who spread their culture all through the Chubut river valley up to the Cordillera, in a colonisation based on peaceful coexistence with the indigenous communities.
The settlers of old are fondly recalled in their adopted country:
The motivations that guided those settlers were special.
They weren't adventurers looking for a hypothetical City of the Caesars.
Nor were they wandering gold seekers, driven by the allure of easy riches.
Neither were they scientists yearning for knowledge and fame.
They were a group of people who wished to preserve a lifestyle threatened in their homeland, and who were looking, very deliberately, for a place where they could found a new Welsh nation.
They asked for land and respect for their language, religion and traditions.

A characteristic of the Welsh people of Patagonia is their piety, as evidenced by the Welsh chapels tourists can visit on both sides of the Chubut river:
They themselves say that: "When an Englishman arrives somewhere, the first thing he builds is a business.
When an American arrives somewhere, he will surely set up a school.
But when a Welshman arrives somewhere, the first thing he will do is erect a chapel. "
The Welsh chapels, with their simple brick facade and their gabled tin roofs, are the distinctive mark of all the Chubut cities they founded.
They were not only religious centers, but also civil, educational and even judicial.
To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the first Welsh settlers to Argentina, a reenactment of the landing of the Mimosa, the ship that brought the first group of settlers, was staged.
Overseeing this and other events were the governor of Chubut, Martín Buzzi, and Wales' Prime Minister, Carwyn Jones, among other guests. On Twitter, users posted photos and videos of the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of La Colonia in Argentinian Patagonia:
The culture in Chubut also celebrated the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Welsh settlers with a great show... Yesterday, we traveled 700 km. from Puerto Madryn to Esquel.
Sheikh Temur's story briefly made Tajiks pause from discussing more mundane but pressing social and economic problems in the country when it was first aired by state TV in February.
Screen grab from Tajik state media published by RFE / RL.
A 65-year-old man called Saidmahdikhon Sattorov but known throughout Tajikistan as Sheikh Temur was sentenced to 16 years in jail earlier this week for 'illegal land grabbing', 'polygamy', 'extortion', 'desecration of the dead and their burial places', and 'obstruction the obtainmnent of compulsory basic education'.
Sattorov, who attracted hundreds of feet-kissing followers to his cause, claimed to be the 'Last Prophet', a title often reserved for the Prophet Muhammad in the Islamic religion.

In the hearings that followed Temur's arrest in February, the sheikh admitted he has more than one wife, built illegally on lands he did not own, and did not allow his children to attend a school. He requested compassion and mercy for his “old age ” and in lieu of the holy month of Ramadan as he awaited sentencing on July 8.
However, a judge in the predominantly Muslim post-Soviet republic failed to show leniency to the sheikh, who just a few months ago was revelling in the joys of young wives, free land, and disciples that drank the water he used to wash his hands.
Readers of local news websites were more merciful. Although several months ago Tajik netizens were angry at the sheikh and demanded harsher punishments, many asked for him to be released once the court's verdict became public knowledge.
On Ozodagon, a reader named Khayr wrote:
Free this poor man.
All officials are also corrupted.
Respected judge, did you buy your expensive car and luxury house with just a salary?
Ozodagon, publish!
Another Ozodagon reader Marhabo agreed:
You are able only poor people.
Where is humanity?
This old man might die in the prison.
A commenter Kalkhoznik, writing under an article on the sheikh's sentencing published on the Asia Plus web-site was surprised by the length of the sentence:
It is hard to understand the reason behind this verdict.
Sheikh was a Sufi, had no interest in politics, lived somewhere in the mountains, did not bother anyone, and for those crimes he was charged... It remains a secret why they wanted to punish him so publicly.
For other observers, however, the reason is obvious.
Tajikistan's government has clamped down on all representations of Islam beyond a state-sanctioned and highly sanitised version of the religion, in which pro-government imams read out sermons against the country's only faith-based opposition party, and police reportedly subject beard-sporting Muslims to forced shavings.
While Sheikh Temur's charlatan behaviour was far from the tenets of the Koran, the authorities may have wanted to send out a message to other sects that might undermine the state's monopoly over religious practices.
Kongish Daily challenges readers ’ ability to understand phrases mixing Cantonese and English.
The line, "What spring r u upping?" can be translated to "What the f * * k are you talking about?"
[Editor's note: This post was written by Kris Cheng and originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on August 6. It is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.
Chinglish refers to spoken or written English influenced by the Chinese language.
In Hong Kong, where the majority of residents speak Cantonese, the term "Kongish" helps capture the distinctive character of Cantonese-style Chinglish.
"Kongish" is used mainly in written form via SMS, chatrooms and social media as some find the Chinese character input system less convenient than English when using mobile devices.]
A Facebook page presenting Hong Kong news in the island's distinct brand of “Chinglish ” attracted more than 15,000 likes overnight.
Kongish Daily, the motto of which is “Hong Kong people speak Hong Kong English, ” became an instant sensation locally after it published a number of stories only people fluent in both Cantonese and English could understand.
One of the first posts on the page was the “$400k helicopter proposal ” story, which has presently gathered more than 11,000 likes.
The page uses phrases like "even ng eat ng play" (literally “even not eat not play ”), which means“ even if we do not spend money on food and fun. ”
In another post, Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan was referred to as someone “with so much rice ”.
This expression in Cantonese describes an individual who is rich.
'Kongish'
Cantonese is widely accepted to have six tones. In 1993, the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong developed Jyutping, a Cantonese romanisation scheme.
The system uses numbers next to romanisations of Cantonese words, which indicate their tones.
On the Kongish Daily, however, posts do not include tones.
Readers have to guess the tone of a word based on romanised English words. As such, readers need to have a strong grasp of Cantonese as well as Hong Kong pop culture to understand its articles.
Renata Flores Rivera, a 14 year-old Peruvian, has become a social media sensation for her covers of well-known songs in the Quechua language.
The video of her version of "The Way You Make Me Feel", by the late Michael Jackson, was filmed at the Inca ruins of Vilcashuamán in Ayacucho, Peru and has been viewed more than half a million times on YouTube.
With seven million speakers, Quechua is the second-most spoken indigenous language in South America (after the Guarani). In Peru it is considered an official language along with Spanish even though only about 19% of the population speaks Quechua.
Renata's mother, Patricia Rivera, works for the Asociación Cultural Surca (Surca Cultural Association), a program that aims to teach adolescents from Ayacucho about drug prevention and the Andean region's ancestral language. Renata was part of their initiative. Thanks to her mother, "the youth also speak Quechua."
The association was founded 11 years ago with the goal of achieving a positive attitude change in children and adolescents through art.
According to the newspaper El Comercio, their intention is to preserve Quechua as an ancestral language.
Ana Saroly affirms, in her article "Puede el quechua sobrevivir" (Can the Quechua Language Survive), that the Quechua language became the unifying language of the Inca empire 600 years ago. Today the language runs the risk of decreasing in importance, so there is a need for younger generations to learn it and to feel proud of the language.
Thanks Peru for your greatness. "Another Quechua-language version of a classic rock song by Renata has been shared on Twitter: Renata Flores canta" The House of the rising sun "de The Animals en lengua quechua. https: / / t.co / RDndj2jj9m — JorgeFloresGallegos (@ jorge0911) August 11, 2015
Renata Flores sings The Animal's song "The House of the Rising Sun" in Quechua. Her next song will be "Fallin" by Alicia Keys.

Gladys Chepkemoi was weeding potatoes in her garden the day the men came to burn down her house.
After her mother-in-law told her that rangers from the Kenya Forest Service were on their way, Chepkemoi strapped her 1-year-old son on her back and hurried to her thatched-roofed home.
She grabbed two tins of corn, blankets, plates and cooking pans, and hid in a thicket.
She watched, she said, as the green-uniformed rangers set her house ablaze.
After they were gone, she came out of the thicket to see what was left.
“What used to be my home was now ashes, ” she said.
The young mother is one of thousands of Kenyans who have been forced out of their homes since the launch of a World Bank-financed forest conservation program in western Kenya ’ s Cherangani Hills.
Human rights advocates claim government authorities have used the project as a vehicle for pushing indigenous peoples out of their ancestral forests.
They are not alone.
Dams, power plants, conservation programs and other projects sponsored by the World Bank have pushed millions of people out of their homes or off their lands or threatened their livelihoods. In some cases, governments supported by World Bank money have arrested, beaten and even killed people who objected to being forced from their homes, according to interviews and official complaints.
The World Bank has admitted “shortcomings ” in its protections for people displaced by projects the bank supports. It says it is working to improve its policies and how it enforces them.
The bank also says protecting people in the way of big projects is a “cornerstone ” of its efforts to“ end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. ”
The World Bank fails to protect the Sengwer In Kenya, the World Bank ’ s in-house Inspection Panel found, the bank violated its policies by failing to do enough to protect the Sengwer, an indigenous minority group in Kenya ’ s western forests that includes Chepkemoi and her family.
The World Bank began financing the Kenya Forest Service ’ s Natural Resources Management Project in 2007.
It promised to cover $68.5 million of the project ’ s $78 million budget in an effort to help the KFS “improve the livelihoods of communities participating in the co-management of water and forests. ”
The Forest Peoples Programme, a U.K.-based advocacy group, says the bank ’ s funding of the conservation project put the Sengwer in danger because the project redrew the Cherangani Hills ’ protected Forest Reserve in a way that included thousands of them inside the reserve ’ s boundaries.
This gave KFS officials a pretext for evicting them, according to the group.
Paul Kibet, secretary of the Sengwer Council of Elders, said that cash from the World Bank also provided the equipment the KFS needed to launch its mass eviction campaign.
“After receiving this money, they bought new vehicles. They bought the forest guards a lot of new guns and boots, et cetera, ” he said.
Justin Kipkorir displays some household items destroyed along with his home.
Kipkorir said Kenyan forest rangers raided and destroyed the house weeks earlier.

Authorities have torched at least a thousand Sengwer homes since the World Bank began financing the conservation project, according to accounts by Sengwer and human rights researchers.
They have also jailed dozens of Sengwer for farming without permits and trespassing on lands that their clans have occupied “since time immemorial, ” a formal complaint from a group of Sengwer to the World Bank claimed.
The KFS says it has not carried out “forceful ” evictions of the Sengwer and that“ genuine persons deserving resettlement ” have been “extensively profiled through a consultative and participatory process. ”

Members of the Sengwer, an indigenous group, claim Kenya Forest Service rangers have tried to drive them out of their ancestral forest by burning their homes.

According to bank officials, Kenyan authorities agreed to stop the evictions until they found new land where the Sengwer could relocate.
Sengwer leaders said the land offered by the government was treeless and barren.
The evictions and burnings continued.
Paulina Sanyaga said that after the KFS torched her home in March 2011, she slept in the forest with her children.
Her youngest was 5 years old at the time. “My child asked why we were sleeping outside, and I told him that the government had burnt not ours alone, but everybody else ’ s house too, ” she recalled.
Because her fence was destroyed by KFS men, she said, many of her cattle and sheep were lost or stolen.
“It felt so painful to lose them, ” she said.“ They were my own sweat. ”
John Chebaraa, a 60-year-old father of seven, said he slept in a caved-in tree trunk the night after his home was burned in mid-2011.
“It was very cold, ” he said.“ When I woke up the next morning my body was grayish and pale. ”
They slept in it for months instead of building a permanent house, she said, “because KFS were always patrolling nearby.
If we built another house, they would have burned it down as well.
So we waited until they stopped patrolling the area. ”
The fire set by the KFS consumed their millet, five sacks of corn and four beehives, Chepkemoi ’ s husband, Brian Bett, said.
The family only had potatoes and milk to eat.
“I did not have enough food for the family to eat, and we often had to sleep hungry so that my children could eat, ” Bett said.“ My children have faced a lot of difficulty and they cried a lot, because they are young and do not have the ability to explain what is ailing them. ”
Kenya ’ s government continued its relocation push after the World Bank ’ s funding for the Natural Resources Management Project officially ended in June 2013.
In early 2014, advocates for the Sengwer reported that authorities had begun a new wave of evictions, writing to United Nations agencies that things on the ground were “chaotic, ” with some people moving with their children and belongings“ to nowhere in particular. ”
The bank, noting that it was no longer funding the forest conservation project, said it was “not linked to these evictions. ”
World Bank officials argue the bank is not to blame for any of the evictions carried out by the KFS because the Kenyan government has been evicting the Sengwer for decades and continued doing so after the bank ’ s official role ended.
That emboldened Kenyan authorities to go forward with a removal campaign that grew increasingly aggressive during the World Bank ’ s sponsorship of the KFS, he said.

In September, reporters witnessed two gutted, smoldering homes and several fences still burning.
Residents said forest rangers had set the fires hours before.
“I don ’ t understand why they chase us like this, ” Selly Rotich, a mother of five, said as she sat outside her scorched home.
The next day, nine KFS rangers confronted reporters as they entered the forest, demanding why they were talking to the Sengwer.
“These guys are squatters, ” said one officer, who declined to identify himself.
“They are not allowed to be in the forest.
They are here illegally. ” Reporters asked the rangers if they were the ones who set fire to Sengwer homes the day before.
Another ranger responded, “You are being lied to.
You are being misled by the people.

This is an edited version of an article written by Mikhail Matveev for 350.org, an organization building a global climate movement. It is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.
On August 17, a five-minute hearing was held in a provincial court of Surgut District in Russia's Siberia.
The defendant, Sergey Kechimov, a reindeer herder from Yugra and one of the few Khanty indigenous people left, is accused of threatening to kill two workers of Surgutneftegaz – one of the largest Russian oil companies. Being sentenced may cost him up to two years in prison, under the Russian criminal code.
During the hearing, lawyers told Judge Asharina that Kechimov was not provided with translators throughout the investigation.
Despite admitting Kechimov ’ s rights had been violated, the judge decided to proceed with the case.
The next hearings will take place on September 12.
But this is a case that goes far beyond the accusations being levied.
The Kechimov case could be framed as involving a petty crime and deemed unworthy of the public ’ s attention.
According to the case, the conflict rose when Kechimov shot a dog owned by the oil company workers that had killed a reindeer in his herd and attacked him as well.
Oil company workers claimed Kechimov also ordered them out of his ancestral lands and demanded compensation payment while waving his shotgun at them.
Kechimov is one of the last Khanty people living near the Imlor Lake.
For centuries, Khantys have deified and praised nature, believing that no person can take more gifts from her than those she is ready to share.
When the oil companies arrived, the sacred Imlor Lake became an expendable source of hydrocarbons, spoiled by oil and mutilated by ugly constructions.
Unsurprisingly, most of the Khanty people decided not to live side by side with the newcomers, leaving their ancestral lands behind for the oil workers to take over.
Those like Kechimov and the others who dared to stay have became a constant nuisance for the oil companies.
Government measures to protect the ancestral peoples ’ rights are providing effective motivation for oil companies to swiftly get rid of such peoples.
For the locals, the presence of oil companies resembles the days of military occupation – with block-posts, humiliating document checkings and personal searches by private security guards.
So the Kechimov case is not just a conflict between individuals: it ’ s an expression of two incompatible approaches to the relation between people and nature colliding.
A conflict now left for Judge Asharina, at the 2nd sub-district of the Surgut Court District, to resolve.

Eat Your Heart Out, Boston Tea Party.
A Boston Tea Party of sorts, brought to you by Vladimir Putin.
Image edited by Kevin Rothrock.
Following an executive order by Vladimir Putin, Russia has embarked on a campaign of destroying any boycotted foods confiscated on its territory.
The bulldozing, incineration, and burial of tons of illegal edibles is taking place in front of cameras, as a spectacle apparently meant to convey Moscow's commitment to punishing foreign food manufacturers for the West's sanctions against Russia, and as a show of strength that the country doesn't need imports from Europe and North America.
RuNet Echo collects some of the most poignant jokes and statements from Russian-language Twitter about this new war on banned food.
Many of the jokes surrounding the eradication of confiscated food imports play with Russia's sacred World War II iconography, which the Kremlin has intentionally cultivated in recent years, in its confrontation with the West over the future of Ukraine.
The destruction of edible food has been the subject of mockery (Internet users have replaced Soviet heroes with blocks of cheese), and a cause for anger (as the idea of wasting food in a country with a living memory of famine is insulting to many people).
While many of the Russian government's policies seem coordinated to leverage the memory of the Second World War, inciting patriotism as a way of rallying the country to accept certain sacrifices, Putin's decision to burn, crush, and bury hundreds of tons of good food has been an awkward fit with the usual reverence for memories of the war.
Indeed, reviewing the popular tweets about Russia's new food policy, it is remarkable how little the Kremlin's supporters have said about it in the past week.
So far, it's the critics who seem to enjoy a near monopoly on this conversation, at least on Twitter.
World War III: the battle against cheeses, and such
This image re-appropriates a famous painting of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, the celebrated Soviet heroine, executed by the Nazis:
Interrogating a parmesan.
Canvas, oil.
Moscow, 2015.
Alexey Venediktov, the chief editor of Echo of Moscow, Russia's embattled, longest-standing independent radio station, expressed disbelief that Russia's WWII veterans are tolerating the government's new food-eradication policy.
Venediktov compares the relative silence about the destruction of food imports today to a scandal in January 2014 that nearly killed the independent television station TV Rain, when it asked viewers if Leningrad should have been surrendered to the Nazis, rather than subjected to a siege that killed hundreds of thousands of people, due to famine.
The veterans who were so disturbed by question about the blockade aren't bothered by the destruction of imports.
What's that about? Generally pro-Kremlin media personality Vladimir Soloviev, who sometimes ventures to criticize the government (he recently suggested that officials who deny Russia's economic crisis are "incompetent"), expressed shock similar to Venediktov's:
The political cartoonist Sergey Elkin has had some fun, too, with the military angle of Russia's expanded "war" on boycotted food:
My great grandfather used to hit me in the head with a spoon, if I played with my food for only a second at the dinner table.
I can only imagine how badly he'd fuck up Putin now.
Just say no (to illicit dairy imports)
On what is perhaps a lighter note (or maybe not), many online have joked that Russia's approach to illegally imported food seems to be harsher than its methods of combatting illegal drugs:
It's curious that nobody ever thought to set up equipment to incinerate contraband narcotics.
But cheese — now there's the real evil.
Incidentally, nobody in our country publicly incinerates narcotics or bulldozes them into landfills.
How to know if your child is on parmesan.
Got milk?
Many Russian Internet users drawing attention to the food-destruction campaign express shame that their country is ruining a vast amount of edible food simply for political reasons.
An earlier plan to feed the confiscated food to cattle, rather than destroy it, produced a similar effect:
Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance is planning to feed sanctioned foods to livestock.
That's pretty much all you need to know about the modern-day Russian state.
The country has completely lost its fucking mind, sadly.
Boston Tea Party, meet Texas Tea
As food prices rise in Russia and an economic recession promises to last several more months, at the very least, many online seem to believe that the country is in no position to bulldoze or set fire to food that many in the country are finding harder and harder to buy.
The popular satirical Twitter personality "KermlinRussia" joked that Russians could be in for a truly rude surprise, if the government's reserves (set up to balance the budget when oil is cheap) become further depleted:
Now people are going to take a step back from all this news about food and ask, "But where are all the dollars and euros from the Stabilization Fund?"
And Putin will be like, "Oh, I incinerated those, too."
Buyer beware
Others have joked that domestic producers of food (in this case, cheese) must be celebrating the crackdown on foreign imports, which eliminates European competition that presumably allows Russians to observe relatively lax health-and-safety standards:
Cheesemakers in Omsk welcome the destruction of perfectly good cheese and pass along a big hello straight from the milk vat.
A nation of ascetics
Some allusions to history are more recent than Russia's experiences in World War II.
Mikhail Gorbachev's famously failed effort to bring down the consumption of alcohol has inspired some quips about Putin's apparent effort to suppress the consumption of food:
The country has really come a long way.
From "DON'T DRINK" under early Gorbachev to "DON'T EAT" under late Putin.
You're going down, cheese
Other jokes have parodied Russia's recent political rhetoric, which is strongly anti-Western, often on moral grounds.
The satirical account "Everything Is Bad" caricatured what an angry Russian patriot might have to say to all the European cheese now crushed and burned in landfills across the country:
NOW WHAT, YOU FUCKING CHEESE.
YOU GOT YOURS, YOU DAMNED, GAY CHEESE FROM YANKEELAND EUROPE.
BURN IN HELL, CHEESE.
Eat the rich
In a mix of World-War-II memory and criticism of Russia's modern-day elite (known to fulminate against European decadence, but also send their children to study and live in the West), KermlinRussia joked that these youngsters might finally be put to the nation's use abroad:
Russia is creating guerrilla groups made up of the children of Duma deputies and other bureaucrats who will go about destroying the sanctioned Western products on the enemy's own territory.
Priorities
The bulldozing and burial of tons of food has reminded some Twitter users of the Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine and carted back to their hometowns in Russia.
The secrecy that shrouds these deaths was the subject of research Boris Nemtsov was conducting, before his assassination. A report based on his findings was later released posthumously. Russia is the kind of country where they bury soldiers secretly and shamefully, but cheese they destroy defiantly and proudly.
Opportunities
Like an illicit advertisement scrawled on a bathroom stall ("for a good time"), or a musician-for-hire looking to attract business, some enterprising cheese venders (or, more likely, some clever jokesters) are already looking to exploit the black market for forbidden European foods: I've been waiting for when advertisements like this would start appearing.
And here we go...

The official announcement has been made for the Second Conference of Women Communicators of Indigenous and African Descent.
The conference, whose slogan is "We occupy the media, we occupy the internet", will take place October 6-10, 2015, at the Centro de las Artes CASA (CASA Arts Center) in San Agustín Elta, Oaxaca, Mexico.
According to the announcement, the conference "looks to foster an exchange of experiences in order to reflect on the challenges and difficulties of the work of women communicators, to delve into topics such as gender and inter-culturalism in the media; community media and legislation; political participation and the empowerment of women, and the use of TIC (Information and Communication Technologies) for communication strategies":
Women who participate in communication projects, are of African descent or come from indigenous communities in Mexico and Central America, will gather to improve on the use of digital tools and to put the information into action by generating communication strategies to use in their projects...
The requirements for participation are:
• Commit to participating during the five days of the conference.
• Currently and continuously work or collaborate on communication projects (radio, photography, documentary video, etc.).
To apply, please fill out the online form available here.
Throughout history, whenever a new communication technology was introduced into society, the Cherokee people have ensured that their written language could adapt.
From the printing press and the typewriter to today's readily available digital technologies like computers and smart phones, the Cherokee language is fully functional thanks to the help of tireless advocates and activists along the way.
As one of the most actively used native languages in the United States, the Cherokee language is spoken by populations in North Carolina and Oklahoma, as well as other states across the country.
While more people are now able to write the Cherokee language with syllabics, which are written characters that each represent a syllable, retaining and encouraging more speakers of the language continue to be a high priority.
The use of technology has been one way to attract increased interest in the language. A new animated video produced by the Cherokee Nation Education Services and the Language Technology Program tells the story of this adoption of new technologies over time.
Narrated by the Cherokee hero Sequoyah, who first created the first Cherokee syllabary in 1821, the video introduces viewers to some of these breakthroughs.
The Cherokee Nation Language Technology Program supports those interested in utilizing written Cherokee with a special focus on digital technology.
Its aim is to create "innovative solutions for the Cherokee language on all digital platforms including smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets and social networks."
Available on its website are valuable resources such as a glossary of neologisms for technology-related terms, keyboard layouts, and fonts.
Communication technology is constantly evolving, and if history is any indication, the Cherokee language will continue to evolve right along with it.
Mount Aso, Japan's largest volcano, suddenly erupted at approximately 9: 40 a.m. on Monday, September 14.
This is the first time in 36 years that it has erupted.
Video of the eruption was captured by cameras installed in the parking lot of an observation area overlooking the volcano.
Located on the western island of Kyushu about 1,200 km from Tokyo, Mount Aso boasts one of the largest calderas in the world.
The 120-kilometer circumference of its caldera is home to towns, farms and resort areas frequented by tourists from all over the world.
The eruptions forced tourists to evacuate, but not before they posted some spectacular photos to Instagram.
We are safe!!!
Dont worry!!
The eruption could be seen from all over the lowlands surrounding Mount Aso's volcanic cone.
Ash fell like raindrops.
Gulp!
Many visitors from other countries uploaded photos to Instagram of the eruption, including this tour group from Taiwan:
This is like witnessing a miracle.
Instagram user aokaeru made a number of posts to Instagram featuring spectacular video of the eruption:
A video posted by Yasutoshi Tomita (@ aokaeru) on Sep 14, 2015 at 6: 24am PDT aokaeru quickly became an Instagram hit, and was approached by several different news organizations wanting to know if they could use his video.
A video posted by Yasutoshi Tomita (@ aokaeru) on Sep 14, 2015 at 4: 07am PDT Photos of the eruption were uploaded in real time.
While an area measuring 4 kilometers around the eruption has been declared off-limits, the people that live within the caldera have no easy way to protect their homes in the event of a larger eruption. I just arrived in Kumamoto, and Mount Aso seems to be... erupting?
Locals will have to learn to live with clouds of ash for the foreseeable future.
This is the first time Mount Aso has erupted since 1979. This aerial view shows just how large Mount Aso's caldera is.

Forest fires in Indonesia brought haze to the country's skies, and the smoke has also affected Malaysia and Singapore.
This has been an annual problem in the Southeast Asian region, typically blamed on drought and land clearings by palm oil companies in the western part of Indonesia.
This year's forest fire was confirmed by Indonesian President Jokowi Widodo on Twitter:
South Sumatra had the biggest number of hotspots. But today the number was reduced from 321 to 129 hotspots.
Last year, forest fires destroyed 8,000 hectares; this year it's down by 1,000 hectares.
Forest burning can't be tolerated anymore. We've discovered the cause and solutions. Companies which commissioned the forest clearing should be stripped of their licenses and brought to justice.
In the future, prevention measures should be the priority.
According to the Center for International Forest Research, forest fires in Indonesia are caused mainly by human activities.
This is the provision in the law which the president wants to implement strictly.
Commercial flights have been cancelled in Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province, where the 'ground zero' of the forest fires is located. Meanwhile, the number of hotspots continues to increase in Kalimantan (the Indonesian territory in Borneo Island).
Most hotspots today were spotted in Kalimantan. Smoke from forest fire in Rengat Inhu Riau. The fire was already contained recently but someone reignited the fire.
On its Facebook page, Greenpeace Indonesia announced the death of a 12-year old girl due to respiratory complications from the smoke.
The girl had been treated in a hospital for one week before her passing.
Greenpeace called for a firm and sustainable solution to the Indonesian haze problem.
Haze Reaches Malaysia and Singapore
Singaporeans and Malaysians have been complaining in the past few days about the return of the haze from the Indonesian fires.
Some used humor to describe the impact of the smoke in their cities.

# haze # singapore unstoppable sneeze and itchy nose.
Indonesia, please stop burning the forrest.
— JEFF (@ itshazeem) September 11, 2015
While the smoke came from Indonesia, some of the palm oil companies that destroyed the forests were financed by companies from Malaysia and Singapore. This makes the annual haze from forest fires not just an Indonesian problem, but a broader regional issue.
Screenshot of a video by Christopher Juárez Reyes, the young Mexican who is documenting the process of his gender reassignment on YouTube.
Hello, I'm Christopher... And I'm transgender.
I'm making this video so I can share my life with you, and my transition and the changes to my body that are going to happen very soon... "
It's with these words that Christopher Juárez Reyes, a young man from Xalapa, Veracruz, begins his first video on YouTube, which launched a series documenting the process of his sex reassignment. In his videos, Reyes also responds to doubts about his transition and shares information about the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities.
He's shared advice about health and medical visits, discussed the paperwork necessary for a sex change, described telling his parents about his transsexuality, and explained how one changes their identity officially, as well as offered many other tips and insights into this process.
Yes, I'm Christopher, the guy who makes videos on YouTube about transsexuality, but I'm not just the transgender guy... I'm so much more, and I know that you're so much more too. "
Christopher's warmth, honesty, and kindness have won him a huge number of followers who regularly encourage him, thank him, and recognize his bravery.
... Don't forget us, don't put us to one side, we exist, we have rights and we have problems (hahaha)...
If you, the viewer, are a writer, or an artist or something in which you can express yourself, I invite you to write, to do something, to speak up, because we have to surround people with this. They often don't use the right terms to refer to us, and it's within us. So please let's do something.
I feel like I'm doing something with these videos, and I hope that I'm doing something so that people more or less understand what this is, and I expect the same from you.
I've already seen lots of people uploading more videos about their changes and it makes me feel great; that's what I wanted.
That's what I'm trying to do with these videos: to let people know, because when I found myself in this situation I either didn't find anything or I found little bits in English, and how much better would it be if they were in Spanish. "
He concludes:
We're all equal, we're all human beings and I hope that I can help in some way. "
Christopher's videos have become much more than a personal project, and this young man now finds himself at the center of a phenomenon bigger than any one person.

A few kilometres from the small Serbian border town of Sid, a dirt track through corn and turnip fields serves as a passage for tens of thousands of women, men and children seeking refuge and lives of greater possibility.
The unofficial border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is surrounded by verdant, sun-lit fields, with apple orchards in the distance and a calm that brings temporary respite to those who have been on the road for weeks, or months.
For a moment, the travelers manage to put aside the threat of militarised borders and the recent memory of dehumanising conditions along the way as they stop to drink freshly pressed apple cider handed out by a local farmer, chat, and rest before they continue on.
Parents carry small children in their arms, toddlers on hips, and on their backs rucksacks containing possessions salvaged from lives interrupted.
Narin, a teacher from Mosul, hesitates as she and her group of survivors, Iraqi Yazidis and Kurds, approach the lone border police car stationed at the point where a corn field in Serbia becomes, a few metres onwards, a corn field in Croatia. “Every step away from Iraq, from the massacres of our people and those we left behind, has been so difficult, ” she says.“ This seems too easy — we ’ ve forgotten what it is like to feel safe. ”
Fatima, pregnant with her third child, arrives exhausted, but despite the heat, dust and distance reminisces about family excursions to her parents ’ village in Syria. Mohammed Ali, her three-year-old son, runs ahead.
“He never lets go of that unicorn, ” Fatima says.“ He feeds it and sleeps next to it and tells it stories about our journey ”.
Mahmoud, a Palestinian student from Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, holding the hand of his young nephew, says: “This is our fate.
We are experiencing what our grandparents and parents experienced.
But with each generation, each exile, we are being scattered further away from home ”.
Later, during the seven hours spent waiting in the heat for their names to be registered by comparatively sympathetic Croatian border police, Mahmoud sings songs of loss, struggle and love to those sitting around him.
Starting at sunrise, the buses arrive, bringing a continuous flow of those seeking refuge from a multitude of situations involving war and conflict, persecution and general precariousness.
A constant amongst them all, however, is the sense of dislocation and often vulnerability, expressed in words and questions and requests for reassurances, in the tensing of shoulders and tight inhalations of breath as painful memories from the past — both distant and recent — are recalled. Kamaal and Sabiha, a middle-aged Kurdish couple from Mosul are accompanied by their cousin, the dignified Jamaal, who struggles down the dirt road on crutches. Kamaal had been in hospital recovering from a heart attack when Mosul was taken over by ISIS over a year ago.
He, Sabiha and their eldest son rushed home to find their home ransacked and their four teenage children gone, including their thirteen-year-old daughter.
They stayed on in Iraq searching for them for almost a year before leaving, in the hopes that perhaps their search will be more effective from the outside. As we walk Sabiha begins to cry.
Her husband puts his arms around her, his own shoulders heaving.
Later they cross the border arm in arm, Jamaal limping beside them.
The young, the elderly, those in wheelchairs carried by friends and family, the wounded, families, solo travelers, young couples holding hands disembark from buses in one quiet border town in Serbia and travel the next few kilometres on foot into another quiet border town in Croatia.
From there, in the degrading, exhausting chaos of the weather-exposed Tovarnik train station, the better organised and welcoming volunteer-run rest-camp next to it, or in a recently established government-run processing camp, they will wait long days for transport that will hopefully take them a step closer to their final destinations — and to the extended family, friends or support networks that await some of them there.
Later, as night begins to fall, those arriving voice apprehension and doubt.
The path is unmarked except for the presence of a handful of volunteers, and those walking now seek reassurance that the path and its surroundings really have been cleared of land mines, that they will not be detained, that they will not encounter police brutality, accounts of which have filtered back from those who were stranded in Horgos and Roszke at the Hungarian border.
Beneath a striking, star-filled night sky, Khalid, a 77-year old Circassian great-grandfather from Quneitra accompanied by his extended family, walks with a walking stick and politely refuses our offers of help with the large bag he carries on his back.
“Continue to trust yourselves and each other, ” he advises fellow travellers.
“We are strong and will face whatever difficulties lie ahead of us as we have faced everything else on this journey. ” A group of Eritrean women and a lone traveler from Congo share a bag of oranges among themselves.
“We have travelled from further away and are more used to the hardships of travelling and to walking long distances, ” says Mariam, a 22-year old nursing student.
“We are young and strong but it is so difficult to see how all these children suffer. ”
A young Iraqi boy pleads with his father, who is already carrying his younger brother and their luggage, to carry him.
His feet, like those of many others, are blistered and raw, every step painful. He sobs and begs and then cries silently as his father apologetically pulls him onwards, worried that the border might close, leaving them stranded.
We take the boy to the medical tent and hurriedly dress and bandage his feet.
Then they continue on into the night.
Zaynab and Mustafa, two children in wheelchairs, are ferried through the fields with their families in a volunteer ’ s van. Mustafa ’ s mother speaks of the difficulties they ’ ve faced over the past weeks.
The overloaded rubber dinghy in which they crossed the Aegean Sea to Lesvos had begun to sink, and in order to keep it afloat for the final few hundreds of metres to shore they were forced to get rid of any excess weight they could by throwing their possessions overboard.
She had to convince their fellow passengers to make an exception for Mustafa ’ s heavy wheelchair.
Sleeping on the streets and in temporary camps makes keeping him clean impossible.
“I feel like I am failing him, ” she says.“ I cannot change or bathe him regularly, and he feels very embarrassed when I have to do so without privacy. ”
Rima, a young law student from Aleppo, Syrian, and a mother herself, accompanies 8-year old Hiba, recently orphaned.
Hiba ’ s remaining family live in Sweden and are awaiting her.
She looks around, wide-eyed, at the hundreds of people walking with them through the fields.
The stars above and thin crescent moon are insufficient to light up the path, and the walkers rely on the lights of mobile phones to help them stay together as certain family members slow down, exhausted from their travels and the hundreds of kilometres many of them have already covered on foot.
For many of those making the crossing, the journey is far from over, and they are acutely aware of the heavily securitised borders to be crossed, the humiliating conditions they ’ ll still have to endure.
But the resilience, courage and strength of those seeking refuge is immeasurable, as they walk through these fields, down the roads and through the borders that will take them towards hoped-for possibilities that allow them to rebuild lives of dignity.

Renowned Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flórez heads an organization called Symphony for Peru, inspired by the National Network of Youth and Children Orchestras of Venezuela.
The group provides musical training disadvantaged children.
Flórez's organization has been active for five years already, and the results so far have been positive. According to a report by Peru's Bureau of Studies for Development, "participants develop a higher self-esteem, greater tenacity to achieve goals, increased creativity and better ways of living together in society."
Writing for En busca del milagro peruano (Pursuing the Peruvian Miracle), Pablo Macalupú-Cumpén says Symphony for Peru uses music to foster values that last a lifetime:
intervenes and reforms children as rigorously as possible — hundreds (maybe even thousands already) of children nationwide, and the best way to do it is with music, because music, as English psychiatrist Anthony Storr said, has the capacity to transform our existence completely.
There are currently about 800 children participating in Symphony for Peru. They come from four different areas of the country, according to Development Effectiveness Overview (an annual report produced by the Inter-American Development Bank to show the results and impact of its work):
The project established four musical centers in four very different areas in Peru: the marginalized, urban ghettos of Trujillo (coastal), Huancayo (mountain), Huánuco (rainforest), and Manchay-Lima (desert).
Each center brings music to almost 200 children and adolescents living at or below the poverty level.
The setting of the program helps children build their self-esteem, encourages them to have goals in life and to achieve those goals, promotes improved school performance, strengthens family ties, and facilitates positive involvement in their community. Twitter users have also been busy discussing and even promoting the planned activities of Symphony for Peru:
"El Cóndor Pasa" performed by Symphony for Peru. Symphony for Peru: the power of music that generates sustained development.

This photoshopped photograph of Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Mickey Mouse ears has landed Facebook user Amr Nohan to three years in prison, according to reports
An Egyptian Facebook user has reportedly been sentenced to three years in prison by a military court for drawing Mickey Mouse ears on president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and posting it on the popular networking site.
Amr Nohan allegedly was charged with the all too common "attempt to overthrow the regime."
Online comments indicate that Nohan is a conscript, and that is why he was tried at a military court.
Many Egyptians have reposted the Sisi / Mickey Mouse photograph, expressing their outrage over the sentence.
Tarakiyee notes how the Sisi / Mickey Mouse image is being widely shared after the sentence:
Amr Nohan was tried by Egyptian military court and sentenced 3 years for a photo.
@ Hon _ _ 3 ridicules how fragile the regime is when it is threatened by a photoshopped image:
Talk to me some more about a fragile regime which thinks that a photograph that ridicules it can overthrow it
@ shai _ sada quips:
Three years for Mickey Mouse's ears.
What would have happened if he got Donald Duck's beak?
Shaima Elbanna tries to reason:
Imagine when you spend three years in prison for a photograph you uploaded on your account. Yes, this is the stupid country
There is little more information about the case at the moment, apart from these and other comments on Twitter.
Supporters are drawing attention to Nohan's case under the Arabic hashtag # الحرية _ لعمرو _ نوهان which translates to # Freedom _ for _ Amr _ Nohan.
Musicians playing inside Tai Wai MTR station.

This post was written by Kris Cheng and originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on October 4, 2015.
The edited version below is republished on Global Voices under a partnership agreement.
More than a hundred people joined a protest at Tai Wai metro station on Saturday evening, October 3, against the ‘ selective ’ enforcement of the Mass Transit Railway's (MTR) bylaws regarding luggage.
Demonstrators wielding guitars, accordions, trombones and bagpipes, were responding to a Facebook campaign urging citizens to take their musical instruments on to the MTR system.
It followed an incident in which a Baptist University music student was warned by MTR staff for bringing his cello into Tai Wai station last month.
Some accuse staff of harassing musicians while turning a blind eye to oversized luggage carried by tourists and parallel traders-mainland Chinese who buy up Hong Kong goods and carry them back over the border to resell.
'Stand up against injustice'
Mavis Lung Man-wai, a yangqin teacher who started the Facebook campaign, said that she was happy with the protest turnout.
I feel we have achieved our goal, because we have received a lot of media exposure.
No matter whether MTR ’ s response can meet our demands or not, we have done what we can do.
Although the MTR Corporation promised a public consultation on luggage policy, the company did not respond to Lung.
MTR didn ’ t talk to me at all.
I ’ ll send emails to them in my personal capacity to ask for exemption for musical instruments … I hope musical organisations such as the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra can do more, art organisations like the Arts Development Council, and universities that have a music department, as students are the ones that need to travel by MTR.
Lung added that she would not usually carry her yangqin onto the MTR, but she started the campaign “to stand up against injustice. ”

Double standards?
Around half of the protesters were from localist groups that promote values and culture of Hong Kong people such as Hong Kong Localism Power, which claimed the MTR did not enforce their own bylaws on parallel traders, yet picked on local people.
One of the protest placards read, “Prosecutes HK Citizens only but not Chinese Smugglers-No MTR Corruptions ”, while another read,“ MTR staff take bribes and assist smugglers evading taxes. ”
Most of these protesters did not bring musical instruments but chanted slogans against the MTR company.
I live in Lohas Park, I have to take MTR with my cello.
I have had it for ten years and it was fine before – it ’ s not reasonable to give warnings to people with musical instruments now.
It ’ s disturbing many students, but they have no choice.
Miss Ng with her cello.

She said her cello was a full size one that was 134 centimeters tall-4 centimeters over the MTR guidelines.
'It would be nice if there were special carriages'
Patrick Brousseau, a teacher wearing a kilt, drew lots of attention with his bagpipes.
Brousseau had an alternative suggestion for the MTRC:
Considering that the first and last cars usually have bigger open spaces, the MTR just people with oversize baggage to go to those cars.
I think most people would say ‘ yeah, I can do that ’, right?
It would be nice if there were special carriages, because then it would help transport bicycles on the train.
But also I don ’ t think that the smuggling problem is going to go away very soon If the MTR actually introduce baggage cars … for people transporting goods to China … they can make a ton of money, and kill two birds with one stone.
Painter Perry Dino, who is often seen at protests, said:
MTR should give people a chance to bring musical instruments, as some are teaching music for a living and don ’ t have money to take taxis or vans.

Dino added that his paint set exceeded MTR luggage guidelines when expanded. “I am prepared to be fined here, ” he said.
Mr Lee, who brought a symbolic yellow umbrella instead of an instrument, said:
Hong Kong people should protect children ’ s right to learn music.
Why not now?

Monitoring the path of Typhoon Koppu as it batters the northern Philippines.
Image from @ govph.
Typhoon Koppu (known locally as Lando) has battered the northern part of the Philippines, affecting almost 300,000 persons in six regions of Luzon, the country ’ s biggest island.
Koppu brought heavy rains that caused massive flooding in several provinces.
The rains also destroyed agricultural crops in the Cagayan Valley, a region known for being the food basket of Metro Manila and other urban centers of Luzon.
Koppy also disrupted the communication signals in many areas, leading to delays in media reports, as eyewitnesses were not immediately able to share photos, videos, and other information about the impact of the typhoon in remote villages.
Despite this problem, following the Twitter hashtag # LandoPH is still one effective way to monitor the flood situation and relief efforts in the disaster-hit towns.
Some of the following photos show the kind of damage Koppu did in the Philippines.
Casiguran in the Aurora Province was particularly badly hit:
Houses destroyed in Casiguran, Aurora because of Lando
Casiguran District Hospital Damaged by Typhoon Lando
Koppu also destroyed several rice fields and other crops.
This is a double tragedy for farmers, many of whom spent the past few months enduring a prolonged drought:
Antonio Flores, a peasant leader, urged the government to provide quick assistance to farmers:
To immediately help farmers, a moratorium to the payment of land rent and land amortization in typhoon-affected areas and waiving of irrigation service fees are just and necessary relief at this time of calamity.
The National Food Authority should also be ready to buy farmers ’ palay (unhusked rice) irregardless of classification, wet or dry, for them to recover the cost of production.
At the same time, we demand government to extend full subsidy to the next production season.
Floods engulfed Cagayan, a province located in the northernmost part of Luzon:
Koppu also affected Metro Manila.
In Marikina City, an eastern suburb, some residents were evacuated because of the Marikina River's rising water levels.

As the largest city in South America, in a place where history is intimately linked with migration, São Paulo will host the seventh edition of the World Social Forum on Migrations (WSFM, or FSMM in its Portuguese acronym) in 2016.
The announcement came from the International Committee of the WSFM, the organizers of the event.
This will mark the second time the Forum on Migrations makes its home in Brazil.
Previously, Brazil had set the stage for the first edition of the WSFM in 2005, in Porto Alegre, a city that had also hosted the first edition of the annual, larger World Social Forum in 2001.
Since debuting in 2005, the biannual editions of the smaller World Social Forum on Migrations have taken place in Madrid, Spain, (2006 and 2008); Quito, Equador (2010); Manila, Philippines (2012) and Johannesburg, South Africa (2014).

“The forum represents a recognition of the struggle over many years of social movements in the city, above all, that of immigrants, who are increasingly taking on more leadership roles.
I believe migrants will be the key players in this process, "says Paulo Illes, immigration policy coordinator for the municipality of São Paulo and member of the forum's organizing committee.
The exact dates and location have yet to be determined, but the event is being planned for mid-2016.
The slogan for the newest edition of the WSFM will be: “Migrants: building alternatives to disorder and the global capital crisis" (Migrantes: construindo alternativas frente à desordem e à crise global do capital, in Portuguese).

Rihab Massif, originally from Lebanon, was my daughter's preschool teacher in Austin.
As a little girl, Camila, my daughter, spoke mostly in Spanish.
And Massif remembers a day when Camila was frustrated because she couldn't remember a word in English.
"She was telling me about her camis," Massif says.
Camisa is the word in Spanish for "shirt," and Massif understood it perfectly because camis means the same thing in Arabic. "And I was like 'Oh! There are some words related to Arabic,' ” she says.
To see just how many, Massif and I did an exercise.
I'd say a word in Spanish, and she'd say it back in Arabic.
"Aceite?"
"We say ceit," Massif says.
"Guitarra?"
"We say guitar."
Now that I am aware, it seems like I hear Arabic words everywhere.
Take, for instance, one of my favorite songs by Latin Grammy winner Juan Luis Guerra.
"Ojalá Que Llueva Café" is peppered with words like café (coffee) and ojalá (God willing, or hopefully) — both of which come from Arabic.
Or, take late salsa singer Celia Cruz's catchphrase, ¡Azucar!, meaning sugar, based on another Arabic word.
Linguist Victor Solis Parejo from the University of Barcelona in Spain says part of the language Spanish speakers use comes from a legacy of the Moorish influence.
“Moors ” was the name used to refer to the Arabic-speaking group from North Africa that invaded what would become Spain back in the eighth century.
Their influence lasted about 700 years and is still visible today.
"Especially if you travel south of Spain ­.
For example in Merida, in the city where I was born, we have the Alcazaba Arabe, an Arabic fortification, "Parejo says.
"So, you can see that in the cities nowadays, but you can also see that Islamic presence, that Arabic presence in the language."
And of course, that presence traveled to the Americas with the Spaniards.
About 4,000 Spanish words are believed to come directly from Arabic.
That's why Maria Gutierrez, a Mexican aid worker with a non-profit in Jordan, says she carries a small notebook with her wherever she goes.
"Yeah!
I'm trying to track all those words. It's like, ‘ One more word! ’
At least every day I'll find a word, and I'll be like, 'Oh, it's exactly the same as Spanish!' or, 'It's very close to Spanish,' "she says.
The sooner Gutierrez masters the language, the sooner she'll be effective with her aid work, and right now being able to speak Spanish is giving her a shortcut.
But why should this merger of Spanish and Arabic matter to Americans?
Well, the two most spoken languages in the United States are English and Spanish.
So, some wonder what could happen to these languages as time goes by, including Parejo.
"Languages are alive, ” he says.
Languages adapt and borrow words from each other, especially those that live in close proximity.
"I still remember when I first came to Texas, ” Parejo says.“ I went to this restaurant with my wife and the waiter asked us, 'Do you want to have dinner inside or do you want to go to the patio?'
I never heard that word in English. "
Patio is a Spanish word.
If the influence exists to the point that we often joke about the existence of "Spanglish," imagine what Americans will be speaking in, say, 100 or 200 years when tens of millions more Spanish-speakers may be calling the US home.
Each year the Summits are attended by Nobel Prize Laureates and prominent global figures, who are active in the social, scientific, political and cultural areas.
In his acceptance speech, Pérez Joglar reflected on what peace is and how people can nurture it:
From that first moment, that first insult, since we awake in the morning and curse that first person, peace diminishes.
Because there are more good people in the world than bad people.
Pérez Joglar, who is Puerto Rican, has lent his voice to numerous causes over the years, among which are UNICEF's campaign to stop human trafficking, and the release of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar López Rivera.
He has also supported the students of the University of Puerto Rico in their protests during the period of the Luis Fortuño administration and the families of the 43 disappeared Ayotzinapa students in Mexico.
Adding to an already great week for Calle 13, their music video, "Ojos color sol" ("Eyes the Color of the Sun"), won a Latin Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video.
The clip of the song, co-written by Cuban legend Silvio Rodríguez, has already been watched over 40,000,000 times on YouTube.
Saúl López, author of a senior thesis about the relation between orality, information, and communication technologies.
Photo used with permission.
Saúl López, or Kuyujani (his indigenous name), is a young Yekuana man who has dedicated most of his life to studying the realities of his ethnic group.
In conversations with the community's elder and leaders, he became aware that one of the group's main problems is that the Yekuana language is endangered.
Faced with this situation, he decided to apply his particular interest in media and technology to a thesis project about the Yekuana language.
The Yekuanas are an indignenous people from the Cariban family, also known as Maquiritares or Makiritares, who mostly reside in the Upper Caura, Erebato, and Nichare rivers, and the Upper Ventuari, Parú, and Cuminá rivers in Venezuela. Their current population is estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 people.
For the last five years, Saúl has been a student at the National Experimental Indigenous University of Tauca (UNEIT) in Venezuela, which was established by an indigenous rights organization in cooperation with Jesuit priests.
Since he entered this institution, he's had a special interest in social media outlets and information and communications technology.
He's seen frequently around the university's campus — a camera in hand — documenting lectures, student meetings, and cultural events, conducting interviews, and even carrying out simulated transmissions of indigenous students' Sunday football games.
Doing this, he's collected a wealth of footage (producing short documentaries, short films, community activities, UNEIT news bulletins, and video clips) that he's used in work that's now inspired him to pursue a degree in bilingual education with a specialization in Indigenous Communication.
Map of Venezuelan Bolívar State, place of investigation work.
His thesis, titled "Influence of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Ye ´ kwana Orality.
Case Jüwütünña del Alto Erebato community — Bolivar State, "studies the relationship between new technologies and the phenomenon of communication in Yekuana culture (especially from the perspective of the community's youth).
The thesis is now in its final stage of revisions, and isn't yet published.
The research is an important contribution to the revitalization of Yekuana orality, as it offers an important collection of reflections and opinions about the value language has for this indigenous community, which stretches from along Caura river to the Ventuari river basin.
The work contains conversations and interviews with elders and senior representatives of the Yekuana universe, as well as dialogues with specialists about communication, education, and technologies, giving the research an important intercultural and multidisciplinary perspective.
Saúl shared with Global Voices what his research means to him:
It has been a particularly interesting work.
I've been able to chat for long hours with the elders from my community and to know part of my community history — things I wasn't aware of that are now registered in my thesis.
About the importance of the Yekuana language, he says:
Our culture is mainly oral.
All we are now, we owe to our language, which is in essence our culture. It's important to understand that technologies and mass media can be made to serve our communities and cosmovision, revitalizing and protecting our orality by recording and documenting our stories, myths, and traditions — of course as education for younger generations.
Saúl presented his research on October 13 to elders and wise men from different ethnic groups, as part of the celebrations of the 2015 indígenous Resitance Week, held every year at the campus of the National Experimental Indigenous University of Tauca.
The thesis was unanimously approved.
Saúl will now be part of the faculty at UNEIT and is already organizing training workshops in some indigenous communities in Southern Venezuela.
He says:
The aim is to multiply and inform other ethnic groups about the importance of our aboriginal languages and to look for mechanisms that will allow us to defend them and keep them alive.

Chang is a student at the Duranno Father School in Centreville, Virginia — home to a growing Korean community.
The Father School is a four-day retreat of sorts, designed to transform stoic Korean dads into more loving and involved parents.
The oldest student is in his 70s, the youngest is just 27, and almost all have something in common — their wives made them come. “She basically signed up and said, this is the start date.
Go ahead and go, ” Chang confesses.
“But I ’ m glad I did it.
They had homework, you know, that I normally wouldn ’ t do.
It gave me some insights. "
We ’ re in a church fellowship hall, where a live band plays modern Christian hymns, and the men sing along, followed by lectures and activities, including a lesson literally on how to hug.
One arm here, bring the other person close, and no patting on the back.
A volunteer in his 40s talks to a younger man in his 20s.
“Do you think your father loved you? ” he asks.
The younger man pauses, and the older one answers for him. “Yes he did. He just didn ’ t know how to communicate it. ”
The Duranno Father School was started by a church in Seoul in the 1990s, as a response to an epidemic of absentee fathers in South Korea.
Korean men work some of the longest hours in the developed world, Confucian values praised them for not expressing their emotions, and for some, it was the norm to physically discipline their kids.
By the third day, a few students have already dropped out. But those who remain are surprisingly honest in their sharing.
Most say they ’ ve been disappointed by their own fathers, one worries about his teenage son, and another confesses he doesn ’ t see much of his grown children.
A few admit with chagrin that they ’ ve turned out to be a lot like their own dads.
At the Father School graduation, men wash their wives' feet, just as Jesus washed the feet of his disciples in the Bible.

And the school ’ s not just about being a better dad.
The men are assigned homework, like writing letters to their wives, and sharing a list of 20 reasons why you love her. Give her the kind of the attention you did while you were dating, the instructor urges.
One of the men shares the heartfelt letter he ’ s written to his wife.
Since coming to the US four years ago, he admits life has been harder than he expected.
“Living in a small apartment with children, unable to speak the language or find work, ” he says,“ we grew tired, and said more hurtful words than we intended. ”
As it turns out, parenting is hard, and the stresses of immigrant life only make it harder.
So a version of the Duranno Father School launched in the US in the early 2000s.
A Korean version meets the needs of more recent immigrants, while an English language school serves the next generation.
Over the years, the school has expanded to more than 40 countries around the world, with more than 300,000 graduates.
In fact, the school is staffed entirely by graduates.
The older men say they don ’ t want to see younger dads repeat their mistakes.
They don aprons and serve up coffee, as they share their own stories during breaks. Frankly, they say it ’ s easy to revert to their old selves in a matter of months, but in coming back to volunteer, there ’ s a community that keeps them accountable, says alum Dave Lee.
“Even though I fall back on it sometimes, ” he says,“ through this school, it made me closer to my family — my wife and my children. I ’ m able to reflect back on things I ’ ve done wrong, or could have been done differently. "
A couple poses for their graduation photo at the Duranno Father School.

Families are invited to join the fathers for their graduation ceremony.
The men change into the school ’ s signature referee striped shirts, as a symbol of their transformation.
At the close of the night, the men file in with towels over their shoulders.
They kneel before their wives and wash their feet gently, just as Jesus washed his disciples ’ feet in the Bible.
Women lean forward in their chairs, dabbing their eyes with tissues.
I meet a woman in her 50s, as she links arms with her husband and waits in line for their graduation photos.
She ’ s holding flowers and eager to talk about the changes she sees in her husband.
“You know, Korean men, they enjoy drinking. ”
She says her husband has agreed to drink less, and she ’ s thrilled.
“I ’ m so happy to hear about this. Yes very, very happy. ”
Fathers put their arms around their children, and smile for the camera — their wives look relieved and hopeful.
Meanwhile staff are already circulating, recruiting new graduates to join their ranks as Father School volunteers.

ABLOGUI, the Guinean association of bloggers, have announced the launch of a new project and a conference named Africtivistes on their website GuineeVote.com.
This event will mark the formation of a league of African bloggers and cyber-activists.
The project wants to build on local initiatives such as the website GuineeVote.com, which was created to encourage participation during the presidential elections on October 11, 2015, in Guinea and disseminate other election news. This event to launch the Africtivistes project will be held in Senegal ’ s capital of Dakar:
Over the next three days — from November 26 until November 28, 2015 — cyber-activists will meet in Dakar, Senegal, to launch Africtivistes.
Africtivistes is the league of African cyber-activists for democracy. The topic of the conference is' The African continent is engaged and determined to guarantee and construct democracy ’.
Participants will finally meet after years of interacting online over social networks.
Online social networks made this formation of bloggers and cyber-activists possible.
These social networks have initiated diverse campaigns, such as # CIV2010 in Cote d ’ Ivoire during the 2010 elections, and Sunu2012 in Senegal for the 2012 presidential elections. African activists also contributed to monitoring the last election process in Guinea, attracting more than 400 e-observers.
The following is a video broadcasted on international TV channel TV5 Monde on September 14, which showcased some of the initiatives that will be presented in Dakar:
Typical calabash gourd where mate is served.

Last November 30 marked the first Day of Mate — a culinary infusion that combines the cultural heritage of several South American countries. Popular throughout the region, it's particularly ever-present in Argentina and Uruguay, where the dish is widely consumed.
The mate is prepared with dry and ground leaves and twigs of yerba mate, also known as yerba from Paraguay.
The name "mate" comes from the name of the calabash gourd that is traditionally used as a container for the infusion.
The history of story of yerba mate has even inspired cartoons, like the one below uploaded to YouTube: Today, it would be unimaginable to ban mate in Argentina, though that is precisely what happened in the 17th century, when sipping mate was considered an "abhorrent habit," and a "dangerous contagion among indigenous people":
In a letter to the king, Negrón explained that “abhorrent and dirty vice that consists in drinking some times during the day the herb with big amounts of hot water. ”
Drinking mate “makes men lazy, which is a total ruin of the earth, and as it is big (both the extension and depth of the vice), I'm afraid it can't be taken away if God doesn't do it, ” claimed Negrón.
Later on, Hernandarias banned the herb (mate).
“May no one, from now on, go nor request Indians to get herb nowhere where it can be found, nor bring it, nor deal nor take on, under penalty of losing it, which shall be burnt in the public square. ”
But the punishment wasn't limited to the incineration of the herb: Hernandarias also sentenced anyone who "smuggled or pretended to smuggle into the city" to 100 lashes.
According to research by the National Institute of Yerba Mate, the average Argentinian consumes up to one hundred liters of mate each year:
In the country, the figures of the consumption of mate speak for themselves: a research by the National Institute of Yerba Mate found out that consumers of the infusion drink an average of 100 liters of ros mate per year.
Each year, purchases of yerba mate are as high as 240,000 tons, compared to the 33,400 tons of coffee and the 6,000 tons of tea.
Mate contains nutrients and provides several benefits to the health of the consumers. In the first place, the xanthines (its main ingredient) has energizing attributes that stimulate the central nervous system, it provides intellectual clarity and enhances concentration.
Furthermore, the yerba mate is an antioxidant more powerful that the ascorbic acid, from Vitamin C. And as if that weren't enough, mate provides the body with vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, E, and up to 15 amino acids.
As usual, the fans of mate used Twitter to express themselves:
Happy National Mate Day!
Bitter, sweet, very hot even dipped; the mate is the great companion of Argentinians.
Cheers! On November 30 Argentina celebrated the National del Mate, the most popular drink in the country. Today is the first ever Día Nacional del Mate (national mate day).
People celebrate it by drinking mate like every other day — Barba Roja (@ djmidwood) November 30, 2015
Christmas in Japan?
One of the hottest Japan memes over the past month has been photos and videos of Joseph Tame running around Tokyo in his "Wearable Christmas Tree." While Tame may not be originally from Japan, his whimsical exploits resonate with a country that has embraced Christmas in its own unique way.
Christmas trees often take center stage.
This display in Tokyo's Shiodome is a perfect example. This year's illumination...
The lights are synced with music and it's really beautiful!
We were so lucky to be a the front of the line to watch the entire show.
The city of Kobe in western Japan is also famous for its December illumination, called the Kobe Luminarie.
The tradition began eleven months after the Hanshin Earthquake in 1995 raise raise spirits after Kobe was virtually destroyed.
December 25, 2015: Merry Christmas to all! # kobeluminarie
Elsewhere in Japan's Hanshin region, someone who couldn't make it to Kobe found a magical Christmas experience of their own:
I couldn't get to Kobe to see the lights, so instead I saw the Christmas tree at Universal Studios Japan.
I didn't go on any rides but it was fun! (⌒ ▽ ⌒) I tried making a yule log... and it tasted delicious!
I'll try making one again. And that's how I spent my Christmas Eve (lol).
Of course, Christmastime in Japan is about more than just stupendous light displays.
Christmas Eve is a popular date night for couples, and baked chicken and a desert of Christmas cake requisite parts of the meal.
This year I'm spending Christmas Eve in Shiodome, at BiCE Tokyo.
The food is really good, and we can look at the Tokyo Sky Tree while eating dinner... it's the best!
Almost every corner of Tokyo is lit up in some way.
Here is the view from Roppongi, in "mid-town", or central Tokyo.
# roppongimidtown # luminarie # midtown # nightscene
Cake plays a key role in how Japan celebrates Christmas.
Here are some delicious cakes from the Pierre Hermes shop in Matsuya Ginza, one of Japan's top department stores.
Merry Christmas from the suburbs!

News reports across the world carried a story about Brunei banning Christmas celebrations this year. Are these reports accurate?
Well, yes and no.
First, it ’ s an old issue.
Last year, Brunei became the first nation in East Asia to implement Sharia, or Islamic law, at a national level. To comply with the law, the country ’ s Ministry of Religious Affairs issued a directive regulating the public celebration of Christmas.
While people outside Brunei may be shocked to learn from the news that Christmas is ‘ banned ’ in the country, but for many Brunei netizens, the real surprise was the delayed reaction of Western media.
Why is the supposed Christmas' ban 'only reaching Western media now? # hypedup — Shiobhan Low (@ shiobhanl) December 23, 2015
if brunei has' banned 'christmas, then why is it still a national holiday? — Faiq Airudin (@ FaiqAirudin) December 22, 2015
Brunei has a Muslim-majority population. It is a small nation ruled by a sultan who wields absolute political power.
The second issue to clarify is that Brunei did not enforce a total ban of Christmas festivities.
Non-Muslim residents and visitors can still celebrate Christmas in their homes, communities, and places of worship.
This is emphasized in the press statement of the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued last year:
… believers of other religions that live under the rule of an Islamic country – according to Islam – may practice their religion or celebrate their religious festivities among their community, with the condition that the celebrations are not disclosed or displayed publicly to Muslims.
The measures taken by the Religious Enforcement Division of the Syariah Affairs Department does not ban Christians from celebrating Christmas at their places of worship, within their community and in their homes.
But if headlines about the Christmas ban are misleading or outdated, the same cannot be said about the coverage of certain aspects of the religious regulation. For example, the directive does criminalize the wearing of clothes that resemble Santa Claus:
… in conjunction with Christmas celebrations, Muslim children, teenagers and adults can be seen wearing hats or clothes that resemble Santa Claus.
Actions such as these can amount to an offence under Section 207 (1) of the Syariah Penal Code Order, 2013.
A person can end up in jail up to five years if found guilty of violating this law.
Early this month, some imams, or Muslim clerics, reiterated the warning that celebrating Christmas can undermine Islam:
During Christmas celebrations, Muslims following that religion ’ s acts – such as using their religious symbols like cross, lighting candles, making Christmas trees and singing religious songs, sending Christmas greetings, using signs praising the religion, putting up decorations or creating sounds and doing anything that amounts to respecting their religion – are against Islamic faith.
News about Brunei banning Christmas inspired many netizens around the world to express solidarity through the hashtag # MyTreedom.
The directive also bans the placing of Christmas trees in public places.
Remember when the Sultan of Brunei banned public celebrations of Christmas? # MerryChristmas # Brunei # MyTreedom pic.twitter.com / c7AFaxJGce — MyTreedom (@ mytreedom) December 20, 2015
Brunei ’ s decision to adopt and strictly enforce the Sharia law last year worried several human rights groups since the law features stoning to death for adultery, cutting of limbs for theft, and flogging for violations such as abortion, alcohol consumption, and homosexuality.
Responding to criticisms, Brunei ’ s Attorney General Datin Hjh Hayati urged the international community to study the positive features of the law: Instead of focusing on the punishment, we should focus on the evidential process which is extremely difficult and stringent under the syariah criminal law.
The punishment acts as a tool and is not the aim of the Syariah criminal law.
In summary, kids both naughty and nice can continue to celebrate Christmas in Brunei, but they better make sure that their Christmas carols, Christmas cards, and Christmas trees are not seen publicly.

The A321 plane crash was among the top events Russians searched for on Google in 2015.
During the past year, Russian Internet users cheered on Eurovision and hockey, but also mourned prominent Russians who passed away and followed the tragic events in Egypt and France, according to Google search data.
As part of its annual Year in Search report, Google gave an overview of the most popular search queries on the RuNet.
In a short video, Google Russia offered a bird's eye view of the most frequently searched items on the Russian Internet in 2015.
Google also provided some charts of top trending items that Russians took an interest in during the past year.
Top events of the year included Eurovision and the World hockey championship (where Russia won silver), as well as the solar eclipse and the 2015 Oscars.
Sadly, many of the year's top events were tragic ones: the A321 plane crash and the terrorist attacks in Paris also made the list.
Russian users were most curious to find definitions of or more information about things like ISIS (aka Islamic State), Leviathan (the hit Russian film that also won a Golden Globe), and the # PrayforParis hashtag, among others.
Top searches for personalities included several prominent Russians who passed away in 2015 or earlier, including pop star Zhanna Friske, politician Boris Nemtsov, ballet legend Maya Plisetskaya, actor Lev Durov, and film director Eldar Ryazanov.
But Eurovision participant for Russia Polina Gagarina also got her cut of fame and ended up in second place among most searched individuals in Russia.
Top searches for popular memes in the RuNet included the Carl meme from The Walking Dead series (which Russians took to with gusto), the "what color is the dress" meme, and the hardly translatable "Ничоси" meme born on the Russian VKontakte social network.

Flickr user yves Tennevin has located and uploaded some fascinating hand-colored photos of Japan from the 19th century, just after the country had opened its doors to the rest of the world.
The photos are all available as part of the public domain, and are assumed to have been taken in Japan in the late 1880s by Italian-born early photographer Adolfo Farsari.
Many of his prints are hand-colored, a practice that was fairly common in Japan in the late 19th Century when Farsari traveled there.
Judging by his photos, Farasari traveled far and wide around Japan, and documented almost everything he came across.

It is fairly obvious that Farsari staged most of his photos.
This means that his portrayal of Japan was not always accurate, and may have contributed to the perception the outside world had about the newly opened country, rather than reflecting how Japan perceived itself.
Unfortunately, not all of Farsari's prints feature captions, so it can be difficult to determine where they are taken.

It is hard to say if this is how Japanese people would have enjoyed a garden, or if it is just the way Farsari asked his subjects to pose for the photo.

It is possible this photo is of Yokohama.
Just thirty years before this photo was taken, Yokohama would have been a quiet fishing village.

On Monday 7 December, Iranians in the north of the country awoke to a country under a layer of fresh white snow.
There is a common misconception amongst those who are unfamiliar with the country that Iran has a tropical or desert-like climate.
In reality, Iran experiences all four changes of the seasons.
The capital city Tehran is surrounded by the Alborz mountain ranges, which boasts some of the best skiing resorts during the winter season.
Snow in December before the official start of winter is rare in Iran.
In fact, the last such heavy snowfall occurred in February 2014, when some roads were closed off because of the unusual conditions.
Heavy snowfall is such a rarity in Iran that in January 2008 a state of emergency was announced for two days, shutting down Tehran, the nation's capital.
The first snowfall of the year was documented by many on social media.
Gary Lewis, the UN resident coordinator for Iran, posted pictures for friends outside of Iran to enjoy the beauty of Tehran's new white views.
Again within the space of a few days, # Tehran like I've never seen it B4.
The teenage great-grandson of the founder of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ahmad Khomeini, posted a photo of a snow-covered tree in Tehran, describing it as "new snow, happy day of students."
Earthquake location 29km west of Imphal, Manipur, India.
Screenshot of map from USGS website.
A powerful 6.7-magnitude earthquake hit Imphal, the capital of the northeast Indian state of Manipur, in the early morning of 4 January 2015, followed by several aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt strongly from many locations in India's east as well as parts of neighboring Bangladesh, which lies west of the quake ’ s epicenter.
Neighbouring Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan were also touched by the tremor.
Many buildings in Imphal and surrounding places experienced structural damage, and mud houses were destroyed in nearby villages.
At the time of writing, at least six people were killed and 90 injured in India.
In Bangladesh, so far four people were killed in earthquake-related incidents and a number of buildings were damaged.
According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake was caused by sections of the earth rubbing alongside each other at vertical, or nearly vertical, fracture points in what is known as a strike-slip fault.
The earthquake hit at 4: 35 in the morning local time at a depth of 17 kilometres below the ground level.
People who felt the shaking took to Twitter to update the world.
Aaman Wadud tweeted from Guwahati, about 300 kilometres from the epicentre:
Just experienced the strongest # earthquake of my life.
Guwahati is shaken.
It's 4: 41AM and my entire neighbourhood is out on street. — Aman Wadud (@ AmanWadud) January 3, 2016
Sorokhaibam Akee posted an image of a damaged building:

Imphal ’ s iconic Ima Market, presumably the world ’ s only market where all the traders are women, has been damaged.
Crowdsourced images on the Facebook page of website Finding The Voice showed scenes of destruction.
A commenter, Luwang Laiva wrote:
As of today, the safety within the premises of Ema market cannot be guaranteed... after shockwaves are likely to hit anytime soon..
I hope the authorities do the necessary asap to avoid any casualties...
When the quake hit Bangladesh, thousands of people rushed into the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, about 350 kilometres from the epicentre.
Most of the deaths in Bangladesh were due to panic rush.
At least 29 people were taken to hospital with injuries.
Bangladeshis were tweeting about the quake.
The earthquake was like alarm... woke everyone up, here in Bangladesh.
Waiting for the aftershocks of this quake now.
Be safe, everyone. — Osman Gani (@ Poet _ Osman) January 4, 2016
This earthquake has raised many questions about preparedness in Bangladesh.
A Daily Star report today quoting the Ministry of Relief and Disaster Management revealed that there are over 72,000 risky buildings in Dhaka city prone to earthquakes.

Another year of translations has passed for Global Voices in Spanish.
We start with Antonia Pasqualino, one of our new translators who joined Global Voices in 2015:
I am an English teacher and a senior student on technical, literary and scientific translation into English.
I have recently been accepted as a volunteer translator at Global Voices in Spanish, which to me represents a great joy and a very rewarding experience.
Not only by working with you and being able to put into practice what I've been learning over the years, but also because I am passionate about language.
I love communication and the perfect and harmonious combination of words to achieve it.
Marian Rubio, a translator who live in Spain and has recently started working with Global Voices, writes:
I am a senior student in translation and interpretation in Malaga, Spain.
A few months ago, I started working with Global Voices in Spanish and it is the first time that I have translated articles to be published. This seems to me to be a great opportunity not only to improve myself by getting to know what happens in other countries and learning to work as part of a network, but also to help convey information through other cultures.
Language is what allows us to be part of a society and, thanks to the work of translators, it is not a barrier when it comes to communicating.
Lucas Lanero, another translator who joined Global Voices this year, writes about his experience:
Translating for Global Voices is a lifelong learning opportunity, as it helps us improve ourselves as translators and at the same time makes us learn new things with each text.
You never know what you may encounter in a given post, and when I get confused with a phrase or a term, I tend to think... why didn't I chose another post? But in trying to resolve it, I realize that overcoming these difficulties is what makes me a better translator.
I personally enjoy working as a volunteer translator, and even though I am still a student, in the future I will be able to say that my first experience in this beautiful profession was at Global Voices!
Have a great year!
Verónica Barroso, a translator and English teacher from Argentina, says that for her Global Voices is not just about translating, but also reading stories:
A few months ago I joined GV as a volunteer translator.
At first, I was unsure due to my limited experience, in fact, I am actually finishing my thesis.
On the other hand, I had to learn how to use other methods and programs.
This opportunity allowed me not only to broaden my experience and expertise in translation but also my knowledge of events taking place throughout the world that are not covered by mainstream media.
I get to read stories that I can't find in any other media in my country.
It is very rewarding, therefore, despite lacking time sometimes, I try to keep translating as a volunteer.
Despite what some people may think, being a translator is not so simple.
For 2015, I had intended to go from being a good translator to being a very good translator.
I think I have succeeded, after a year of hard work and study, and with the opportunity and help I received from the Global Voices' community.
I started working at Global Voices as a way of helping, giving and contributing.
But in the end, I ended up benefiting a great deal from the experience.
I am part of an encouraging and supportive community.
My colleagues from GV are very helpful, answering my questions and even sharing reference guide material.
Through the corrections that GV editors made, I learned about the pitfalls of translating from English into Spanish.
I learned to be careful with anglicisms and to transform English sentences into Spanish sentences that sound natural.
Specifically, I learned to avoid passive sentences and gerunds; I had to revise spelling rules; I improved my skills on grammatical agreement and became more aware of all those language pitfalls.
Thank you, Global Voices, for helping me to become a better person and translator.
In 2016, I intend to become an excellent translator.
In a year's time I will let you know if I succeeded. Romina Navarro tells us about her experience in the Global Voices biannual summit: The two things I most liked about this year: the opportunity to participate in the Global Voices biannual summit and meet several of these wonderful GV people, who although coming from very different backgrounds have so much in common with each other, and where we shared a memorable and fun time.
And the proposal that arose at that summit to strengthen ties within the GV in Spanish group to try to do joint articles and reports, to propose new and original ideas and have the freedom to be increasingly creative.
It is impossible to get bored among GVers! Thank you all for this great team!
Last but not least, Cecilia Cardenas from Argentina, who in addition to being a regular volunteer translator also fills in as substitute editor, shares her experience:
In theory the editor's task is basically planning what post will be published and when, to detect and correct spelling, grammar and punctuation errors, to verify figures, proper names, headlines, titles, subtitles and text formatting, to make small changes to improve readability without straying from the original meaning. But at GV it also includes: checking that the system has posted on schedule and if not to do it manually, managing the Twitter account, answering translators ’ questions as soon as possible, sending editorial comments if necessary, updating translated post that have been modified, asking the group to do some urgent, last-minute translation, trying to get all the posts translated, adjusting or modifying titles in order to get Google to treat them better, and being prepared to support editorial decisions should there be any issue.
For example, when I was in charge of the editorial process, there was a day when a last-minute change came up after I'd gone through revising eight posts. It was late, I wanted to go to sleep, so I cut out the title because it was too long for Google and in doing so, without thinking too much, I changed the word caterpillar for bulldozer (topadora), which in my variety of Spanish sounded normal. The following day I received the rightful complaint from the translator who asked me to respect her choice of wording, I obviously made the change and thereafter I learned to be more careful with regional differences.
2015 was a year full of stories, and with eventful political and social dynamics at a global level.
Today more than ever, the Web not only hatches stories, but is the place for conversation about whatever is happening in every corner of the world.
In 2016 we expect to continue being the bridge between those stories and the Spanish-speaking readers, translating for them all the stories published on Global Voices in English, in a timely and truthful fashion.

Practical. Easy.
If you ’ re Peruvian and you live abroad, like I do, then this is something that usually happens to you: you mention your country, and after name-dropping Machu Picchu, people immediately talk about the food.
It happens all the time. Now you can find Peruvian restaurants in every major European city. Tourists from the United States travel to Peru just to visit the new chic restaurants in the capital.
In Lima, there are more culinary schools than in Paris, and chefs are even interviewed by the local press about their opinions on politics, the economy, and the culture.
I ’ m not exaggerating.
A few years ago, I visited a maximum security prison, and to my surprise, I found that one of the prisoners had opened a gourmet restaurant.
I remember the chef told me that his dream was for people on the outside to come to the prison to try his food.
For him, that would be success.
Anyway, that is the situation.
But there ’ s another aspect to this reality, something that has become very clear to me.
If anyone speaks ill about our food, we don ’ t always respond that well.
We ’ ll take a look at two cases and get to know the two people that dared to insult Peruvian cuisine, because I think it reveals something about our idiosyncrasies, and because I think it shows that maybe, something has changed.
And so that no one accuses me of not having enough national pride, let ’ s start by getting one thing clear: I love Peruvian food.
The author, Gustavo Rodriguez, also works as a communications consultant.
Hence, he knows a lot about marketing.
In the case of his novel, the publisher had decided to sell it as the first Peruvian novel dedicated to our cuisine, something he didn ’ t appreciate at all.
"It was a silly way of pigeonholing it because my book isn ’ t about that," Gustavo says.
But it makes sense in a way, doesn ’ t it?
The main character is a chef.
So if that detail is nothing more than a pretense for telling a more intimate story, in terms of marketing, it made sense.
And well, the press release from the publisher found its way into the hands of another author: Peruvian writer and blogger Iván Thays, who lives in Lima.
But aside from that literary and theoretical question in his post, Iván confessed something very serious: he didn ’ t like Peruvian food that much.
And he didn ’ t say it in the nicest way either.
"I said a lot of things that sounded pretty bad such as being unable to digest Peruvian food, that it was a bomb of carbohydrates, that I liked Italian food a lot more in general, and that I didn ’ t think Peruvian food was out of this world by any means."
Iván says. And that he wasn ’ t even thankful for this supposed gastronomic boom.
The next day, the post had comments from about 20 people and some likes.
Gustavo also saw it because Iván had tagged him in a note on Facebook.
Both didn't think much of it.
But while Gustavo was on a flight from Bogotá to Lima, everything changed.
El Comercio, a newspaper in Lima, had published a link to the blog with an alarming headline: “Peruvian writer in Spain says that Peruvian cuisine is bad. ”
El Comercio is the most important and most read newspaper in Peru, and with this blog, Iván and his comments on Peruvian food became news.
Many also interpreted his comments as a critique on Gustavo ’ s book, and therefore, the author saw himself get involved in this mess.
"So there I realized that what I had said was going to be taken much more seriously than what it really meant to me, you know?" says Iván.
Or listen to the episode in Spanish below:
Saudi Arabia today announced it had executed top Shia cleric Shaikh Nemer Al Nemer under "terrorism" charges.
Photo credit: Talkhandak.com (CC BY 4.0) Saudi Arabia announced today it had executed 47 people under "terrorism" charges, including top shia cleric Nimr Al Nimr who was seen as a leader in anti-government protests that took place in the Eastern province of the absolute monarchy at the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring.
In a series of tweets, Saudi journalist Ahmed Al Omran quotes the Saudi state news agency saying:
Saudi Arabia executes 47 on terrorism charges, including Shiite cleric Nemer al-Nemer — state news agency — Ahmed Al Omran (@ ahmed) January 2, 2016
In addition to Nimr, who had called for peaceful protests against the Saudi regime, Saudi Arabia executed Al Qaeda members, who belong to an ultra-fanatic branch of Sunni Islam.
Al Omran tweets:
Majority of today ’ s executions are related to terrorism attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda inside Saudi Arabia between 2003 and 2006. — Ahmed Al Omran (@ ahmed) January 2, 2016
This "lumping" of executions did not pass undetected on social media.
David Kenner explains:
The mass executions were carried out in 12 different areas across Saudi Arabia: The executions were carried out in 12 different regions around the kingdom, the interior ministry says. — Ahmed Al Omran (@ ahmed) January 2, 2016
And they are backed by the Saudi religious institutions:
Saudi Grand Mufti tells state TV that the death sentences carried out today are “just. ” — Ahmed Al Omran (@ ahmed) January 2, 2016 Nimr, from the Awamiya area, in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia caught the Saudi regime's wrath after giving sermons calling for reforms in the conservative kingdom where women are not even allowed to drive cars and for" taking the lead "in anti-government protests in 2011-2012.
In July 2012, he was arrested by police after being shot in the leg and in October 2014 sentenced to death for "disobeying the ruler" among other charges.
On Twitter, netizens expressed anger at Nimr's execution.
American-Mauritanian Nasser Weddady notes:
The execution of Nimr Al Nimr is a rare moment where outrage is transcending sectarian divides. # Saudi — weddady (@ weddady) January 2, 2016
He adds to his 37K followers on Twitter saying:
The real loss in the death of Nimr Al Nimr is that he died for the message both Sunni & Shia tyrants feared from the Arab uprisings. — weddady (@ weddady) January 2, 2016
Having a dissenting opinion in Arab lands is health hazard. side effects include prison, torture and death. — weddady (@ weddady) January 2, 2016
Rawya Rageh tells her 83.3K followers Nimr's execution will further escalate tensions in the region:
Execution of prominent # Shia cleric # AlNimr by # Saudi will undoubtedly set tone for regional tension in 2016. — Rawya Rageh (@ RawyaRageh) January 2, 2016
Iran reacted to Nimr's execution by accusing Saudi Arabia of "support terrorists and takfiri (radical Sunni) extremists, while executing and suppressing critics inside the country."
Nimr's execution is expected to further fuel dissidence in the region with calls for demonstrations going out.
And in nearby restive Bahrain, where anti-government protests have been continuing since February 14, 2011, protesters took to the streets of several villages after the news was announced.
Protests in several areas in Bahrain to condemn the execution of martyr Nimr Al Nimr.
Bahrain's villages rise in anger after the execution of Nimr Al Nimr
Last year (2015), Saudi Arabia executed a total of 158 people, or an average of one person every two days, the highest recorded number since 1995.
A screenshot grabbed from Jonibek Murodov's video clip "Aylan" used from drawings widely shared online
In a country that knows enough about the pain associated with migration, forced displacement and civil conflict, a local pop singer is cutting through the suspicions aimed at refugees following deadly attacks in Paris and turning attentions back towards the human catastrophe of war.
On the eve of the International Migrants Day celebrated annually on 18 December, Tajik star Jonibek Murodov has penned a song for Aylan Kurdi, the little Syrian boy, found and photographed washed up on a Turkish beach in September.
While Kurdi's image generated an outpouring of sympathy across the world at the time, it has been quickly cast aside as migrants are subsumed once more into the terror narrative.
Jonibek sings:
My name is Aylan in all languages of the world,
My soul is sobbing in all places of the world,
Whose knife is in my heart and my sight?
What country is my lonely body buried in?
The song has won admiration throughout Tajik-speaking communities in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, where over a million Tajiks live and work.
Wrote Leila Abdullaeva:
Crying.
While watching this on the news, I didn ’ t have the same emotions I feel watching your video clip.
Oh God, what ’ s happened with this world? However, not everyone thought the tribute was appropriate, given that Tajikistan has its own tragedies to highlight.
Some asked if the singer might take time to commemorate the five-months-old Tajik child Umarali Nazarov, whose death a few hours after being separated from his mother by Russian authorities in St. Petersburg sparked condemnation in both Tajikistan and Russia.
This song is very good.
But are you aware of Umarali Nazarov, the five-months-old child taken from his mum that died far from her? Doesn ’ t his case make you want to create something?
Murodov duly told his fans he is considering singing about Umarali, whose tragic death was actively compared to that of Aylan Kurdi by Tajik internet users. Amid a sea of countless ballads about love a growing number of Tajik pop and rap stars are now moving towards covering more socially-oriented themes including poverty, labour migration and forced military recruitment.

The world is gaga over the final deal agreed on by 195 countries at the Paris Conference of Parties (COP) 21.
The governments agreed to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions to prevent temperatures from rising above two degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, after which scientists fear the consequences of climate change could become catastrophic.
The agreement emphasizes support for developing nations and the least developed countries like Nepal, which have made nominal contributions to global warming, but which are already victims of the visible impacts of climate change.
Nepal ’ s Mustang, the Himalayan district famous for its apples, has not seen any apple production in the orchards of Lete and Kunzo Village Development Committees for the last six years.
Experts connect it to the effects of climate change.
This October, the vultures found in the southern plains of Nepal were seen in the hilly Myagdi district.
According to ornithologists, to evade the increasing temperature in the plains the birds might have flown in search of cooler climate.

Likewise, birdwatchers sighted yellow bittern (Ixobrychus sinensis) at an altitude of 900 metres in the hilly Kaski district for the first time.
The migratory bird is found at 250 metres above sea level in the plains.
The blooming of a flower in the Himalayas has long heralded the onset of Spring, but now, it's flowering too early http: / / t.co / HjtEFtl5Hc — GlobalChangeBiology (@ GlobalChangeBio) July 5, 2014
Not to mention, the untimely blooming of rhododendron in the Himalayas has been linked to climate change.
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) research on the migration of the Apollo butterfly and pika to higher reaches in the Himalayas due to global warming has alarmed scientists, too.
Did you know that pika are a climate change indicator species?
The Apollo butterflies found at 3,000 metres above sea level have moved to 500 metres above their normal habitat, while the pikas have moved to 100 metres higher in the Langtang region of Nepal.
The research also highlighted the movement of the Pieris species of butterflies to 2,200 metres from 1,800 metres as well as a discernible shift in the life cycle of butterflies.
These visible impacts of climate change are like canaries in a coal mine, but the government of Nepal, to cope with the unofficial Indian blockade (see Global Voices report), has been rampantly distributing fuel wood from the forest, drawing the ire of conservationists.
World leaders are in Paris for # climatechange.

Congrats to the team at Mount Lofty Botanic Garden for their success!
Photo courtesy Tom Chladek A corpse flower has bloomed in South Australia's Mount Lofty Botanic Garden.
Known for its size, striking appearance and its stench, its botanic name is the Titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum).
The plant is native to Indonesia's Sumatra island, where its common name is bibunga bangkai, meaning carrion plant or corpse flower.
Despite the repulsive odour, thousands have waited patiently in line to experience its brief opening.
Even the police got in on the act:
Natalie Whiting captured some of the curious crowd on video:

Gulled Adan, the 13 year old innovator Gulled Adan Abdi, 13, was born in Buuhoodle region in Puntland, an autonomous state inside Somalia.
He came from a deprived community.
Gulled ’ s father died when Gulled was still a baby, and as a result he had to care for two of his siblings.
He is now in the third grade.
Despite the hardship Gulled and his family are going through, Gulled assembles toy airplanes, armored cars and fans using spare materials and powered by scrap automotive batteries.
Screenshot of images of toys assembled by Gulled.
Photos taken from the information department of the President of Puntland and used with permission.
Gulled comes from a country that was absorbed by civil war for almost two and a half decades.
The president of Somalia ’ s Puntland government, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, is among those who have praised Gulled for his extraordinary inventions.
Gulled met with President Ali, Vice President Abdihakin Abdullahi Haji Omar and Parliament Speaker at Puntland State House on Monday, 4 January 2015.
Unlike Somaliland to its west, Puntland does not seek outright independence from Somalia. Having declared its autonomy in 1998, the territory's leadership have repeatedly stated their wishes for a federal Somalia.

I am a third grader and none of these things were taught in school, this is something I tried in my free time and I guess it was worth it!
Gulled ’ s mother, Mrs. Maryam Hassan, was more expansive when asked the same question:
When Gulled ’ s father passed away I had to step up and provide for my children, I used to leave them by themselves in order to provide their meals and I used to tie Gulled ’ s legs so that he wouldn't leave the house or get lost because I couldn ’ t afford a babysitter.
In a country the international media mostly refers to only in connection with war, chaos and destruction, Gulled's story is a testimony to the enduring human capacity to innovate, craft and create.

A boy's honesty and a neighborhood's gratitude are two pieces of good news freshening up summer in Lima, where things are heating up not only because of the weather phenomenon El Niño, but also because of the country's ongoing presidential campaign.
On January 14, a Facebook user shared what happened at Cerro Azul beach, located 120 kilometers south of the Peruvian capital:
going to the beach, I dropped my wallet full of cash, documents and cards.
I hadn't the slightest idea that my wallet had dropped until Brando came running and told me, "Here, you dropped this".
Brando is one of many children that take care of cars at Cerro Azul beach.
- I want to ask you a huge favor, every time you come, look for him, so he might be the one who takes care of your car, so he may know that when you do good deeds, life rewards you.
And if you can afford it, I'm sure he'd love a lunch!
Haha Thanks, Brando, because without knowing you not only returned my wallet to me... you returned my hope!!!
The story of Brando's good deed made its way to other websites, which praised his honesty and urged other people to share the tale to "promote good values". Example!
One hashtag, # oBrandobien, made a play on words of Brando's name and the phrase obrar bien, meaning "to do good": Thanks, Brando, because without knowing you weren't just returning a wallet... you were returning hope to the country!!
I pay my respect to BRANDON, the boy who returned a wallet full of money and cards in Cerro Azul.
An example politicians should follow today. On January 16 in Puente Piedra, on the other side of Lima, a fire destroyed a cardboard warehouse.
For hours, more than 40 firefighters units fought the flames until they were able to contain them and put them out.
Their hard work lasted from mid-afternoon until well into the night.
Once the fire was under control, 15 families that live in the affected area decided to show their gratitude to the almost 200 firefighters who responded to the emergency, preparing food for everybody.
Great news! They deserved it =)
Puente Piedra: This is how firefighters were thanked after the fire.
An example to be followed - Puente Piedra: This is how neighbors thanked the firefighters after the blaze.
Fire consumes recycled paper warehouse in Puente Piedra.
Firefighters are especially appreciated in Peru, as they are all volunteers:
The so called “men in red ” prevent, control and put out fires, assist with car accidents and emergencies, and rescue those in danger, all on a voluntarily basis, meaning they don't receive any payment for their services.
Saudi camels enjoying the snow in Tabouk, Saudi Arabia, tweets Aysha bint Abdulaziz (@ ayosh70)
From photographs to videos, from Twitter to Facebook, and from Instagram to Snapchat, we have a minute by minute feed of what it is like for Saudis to experience snow.
The snow, although rare in Saudi Arabia, is more common in Tabuk, in northwestern Saudi Arabia and close to the Jordanian border, where snowfall is recorded once every three to four years.
The Storm Centre shares this snippet of information:
Saudi Arabia: Snowfall on the Dhahr ridge in Tabouk.
Musleh Elharbi tweets:
It's snowing now on Aldhahr ridge and the ground has become white.
Check out the footage on my account on Snapchat.
Aysha bint Abdulaziz shares photographs which may have been taken earlier in the day of sheep and camels in the snow:
Camels in the desert in the snow and what's more beautiful is this flock of sheep
And Fahad Aldhorfari shares a video of snow falling on a car windshield (not a joke), which has been retweeted almost 70 times at the time of writing this post:

Old images of people and places help us realise how much things have changed. Looking at old pictures takes us back to the days when life seemed simpler.
In those faded facades and strange clothes, from one photo to the next, we remember how people once lived. Earlier this month, the New York Public Library released more than 180,000 digitized items in the public domain.
Readers can now access and download these archived materials from the library for free and also remix the materials to develop and share new content.
Among the digital archive are old photographs and sketches from Asia and the South Pacific regions showing how people lived in the then-colonized countries.
The images provide a rare glimpse of architectures and clothes of the undivided Indian Sub-Continent.
Throughout India, you will find a number of beautiful grand palaces, which were built by emperors who ruled the region in different periods.
Perhaps you've seen photos, but have you ever wondered how they appeared before photography was available everywhere?
Take a look.

Messi and Murtaza.
Photo shared on the Facebook group of Shoja Designi.
Now the world is waiting to see when Murtaza Ahmadi will get to meet the Barcelona and Argentina No.10.
Murtaza, whose family is unable to provide him with a genuine Lionel Messi football shirt, grabbed the attention of local media and subsequently the international agencies for his apparent devotion to one of the greatest footballers of all time.
Murtaza's makeshift shirt was fashioned for him by Homayoon Ahmadi, his older brother, who posted a photo of him on Facebook.
His father Mohammad Arif Ahmadi told local station Ariana TV: “He loves football and he loves Messi. he asked me many times to buy a Messi shirt but I could not provide it because in the village where we live, there is no such shirt. ”
Murtaza and His father, Mohammad Arif Ahmadi.
Image widely shared.
Ahmadi also spoke of his wish to see a football stadium in Jaghori district, Ghazni, where Murtaza lives.
"We do not have any personal desires but what we expect is opportunities for our children to have a better future."
After foreign internet users first saw the mystery boy, a rumour developed that he was a Kurdish child from Iraq.
That belief was given added currency when Kurdish TV reported that a boy called Homin, located in Dohuk province, Iraq, was the subject of the photo.
But then Twitter user @ illMindOfRobin claimed that he had made up that story to draw attention to the town where his parents were from. @ xmcrt _ it wasn't iraq. duhok is where my parents were born so i just made it up. every media says iraq without source referencing to me — RobinXVI (@ illMindOfRobin) January 19, 2016
Earlier this week, the Afghanistan Football Federation invited Murtaza and his family to Kabul.
Keramuddin Karim, the federation's president promised to grant him an opportunity to meet Messi.
“We have already contacted Barcelona club and they will respond within 4-5 days about the time and the place where they want to meet Murtaza, ” the federation chief said.
Murtaza appeared photographed in an official Barcelona kit.
An Afghan Facebook user commented:
Every one is waiting to meet # kingMessi Messi is waiting to Meet our little # Murtaza
Because of that we love Messi and soccer
Although Barcelona has not released an official announcement, BBC Persian reported that the Spanish Embassy in Kabul said that they will try to provide the opportunity for Murtaza to meet Messi.
His father has said the meeting will take place in Barcelona at the club's famous Nou Camp stadium.
This would be somewhat ironic as European countries line up to slam the doors shut on migrants from war torn countries, including Afghanistan, but Murtaza's family is unlikely to refuse the opportunity of acquainting him with his idol.
In the meantime, football fans around the world have been displaying their envy:
What happens when people find out that a boy wearing a polythene bag football shirt has the chance of meeting Messi.
Colorized photo of the old legislative building which was destroyed during the Battle of Manila.
Photo from the official gazette of the Philippine government
During World War II, Manila was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army.
In early 1945, American forces and Filipino guerrilla fighters liberated the Philippine capital after a month of battle.
Because of the fierce fighting and heavy bombings, Manila became the second most devastated Allied capital (next to Warsaw, Poland) during World War II.
During the Battle of Manila, more than 100,000 civilians were killed and the city ’ s government buildings were almost completely destroyed.
100,000 Filipinos perished, government buildings lay in ruins — and Manila was Pearl of the Orient no more.
The once illustrious city and the Orient ’ s first cosmopolitan hub that merged the East and West now vanished under piles of debris.
The European heritage of Manila (Philippines was a colony of Spain for more than 300 years) was lost because of the destruction of the city. The government briefer adds:
Filipinos lost invaluable articulations of culture and their identity as a people.
Government buildings, universities and colleges, churches as well as other institutional landmarks perished along with all the valuables in their possession.
Buildings suffered demolition to pave the way for progress.
This meant doing away with European architecture in lieu of the functional, American style architecture that inspires some of our buildings today.
Only few among the original edifices would remain intact.
Take a look at some of the colorized photos of old Manila after the war.
Some photos are also superimposed with how they look today:

While Japanese forces are mainly to blame for killing thousands of civilians, some historians have also accused the American military of bombing government buildings and other infrastructure that destroyed the economy of the country ’ s capital.

Occupying more than 1,000 acres of land beside a road in Thanbyuzayat Township, the salt farms of Panga reflect a shimmering white under the tropical sun in Mon State. They are among the less conventional of various types of farms scattered along Myanmar ’ s coastline, wherein the harvest is gathered from seawater.
About a two-hour drive outside the state capital Moulmein, “salt farmers ” manning the evaporation ponds come into view.
They only work from December to May, when there is sufficient sunlight to evaporate the accumulated seawater, leaving behind its salt.
The ponds, stretching out to the horizon, were previously manned by locals, but as much of Mon State ’ s indigenous population has migrated to neighboring Thailand for more lucrative work, most of the sea salt farmers in Panga these days are from Myanmar's Irrawaddy Delta.

In order to combat corruption, one first has to recognize it and stop treating it as something "normal."
Activists argue that public education is the key to reversing attitudes that allow societies to remain complacent to corruption.
In this context, three youth anti-corruption networks from Central and Eastern Europe are sharing their experiences in a new documentary series about corruption in education, which is now available online:
Corrupt practices are especially visible in education systems.
From kindergarten to university, generations of children and students grow up learning about corruption from their own experiences.
As a result these generations develop particular sets of attitudes and behaviors: "Everything can be bought.
Among other things, there is a message: It's important to succeed, no matter what means you are using to achieve success... ".
Produced by Macedonia's Youth Educational Forum, the series includes testimonies by students, teachers, and activists affected by corruption (and now involved in fighting it) in Macedonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina and Armenia.
The next four documentaries in the series will cover “Youth Networking Against Corruption, ”“ Data and Research on Corruption, ” “Online and Offline Activism Against Corruption, ” and“ Institutional Communication. ”
The networks contributing to the production are the Anti-Corruption Student Network in South East Europe, Global Youth Anti-Corruption Network, and Transparent Education Network.
The decision by a farmer in Hokkaido to chop down an Italian poplar is being lamented outside of Japan.
A tourist attraction in a remote, rural setting, the popular poplar even had its own infrequently updated Twitter account.
On February 25, national news in Japan reported that the iconic "Philosopher's Tree" (哲学の木) in Biei, Hokkaido had been cut down by its owner.
The tree had increasingly become a tourist attraction in recent years, with people traveling to visit the tree to snap its picture.
According to news reports, the farmer decided to cut down the fifty-year-old tree because its falling branches posed a danger to visitors.
As well, many sightseers also did not "mind their manners" (マーナ違反), according to news reports, and were trampling on his fields, despite being requested not to do so.
Someone had even sprayed graffiti on the trunk of the tree.
This is really sad.
The saddest thing is that the owner of the land had no other choice but to cut down the tree.
"Following bad behavior (of tourists), landowner decides to topple tree."
One Twitter user posted screencaps of the News 23 broadcast: "Starting from 3 or 4 years ago, foreign tourists started tramping around the field in search of a good photograph."
Here's the report on the Philosopher's Tree... It's those foreign tourists...
Japan is currently experiencing a tourist boom.
In 2015, nearly 20 million foreign tourists visited Japan, a 50% increase over 2014, and nearly double the number of foreign visitors to Japan in 2010. There have been several other news reports about "bad mannered" foreign visitors, and a recent survey revealed that two in five Tokyo homeowners think foreigners shouldn ’ t use Airbnb.
When interviewed by HTB, the local Hokkaido broadcaster, the farmer who owned the land did not say it was the visitors' bad behavior per se that motivated him to cut down the tree; instead, he claims he was worried that people walking on his fields would introduce disease onto his farm.
Hokkaido is famed for its dairy farms, and in recent years Japanese livestock farmers in other parts of the country have had to deal with disastrous outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, which can be introduced to farms by human visitors.
In the interview on HTB, the farmer made it clear that he did not cut down the tree out of spite:
Some tourists were also sad when they learned the Philosopher's Tree was cut down.
Commenters on a Taiwanese backpackers forum noted:
It might not be a bad thing for that farmer to cut down the tree (because he could not tolerate anymore). However, I still feel sorry for what happened when I read the words, 'So today a machine cut down the tree.'
Another commenter remarked that not disturbing the farm was just common sense:
The Philospher's Tree was not the only beautiful thing about Biei — there's also observing the natural landscape of Biei across the four seasons.
If the tourists go to Biei only to see the tree, they would miss a lot of things that would make great memories of the trip.
If the tourists go to Biei only to see the tree, they would miss a lot of things that would make great memories of the trip.
One Japanese Twitter user posted a poignant message for the now-departed poplar: Without any doubt we pray that new life will sprout up from that spot.
"Farewell, Philosopher's Tree.
And thank you. "
"# EgyptAir hijacker has explosives ….
How did he get them on board? Don ’ t forget though … "tweets @ Andy _ Wirral, who shares the photograph above
A seven-hour stand-off with a hijacker who forced an Egypt Air pilot to divert a flight en route from Alexandria to Cairo to make an emergency landing in Larnaca, Cyprus, after claiming he was wearing an explosive belt, has ended, with all the passengers released.
No one was injured in the incident on flight MS181, which had 81 passengers on board, including crew.
Official sources at EGYPTAIR declared the release of all the hostages and the arrest of the hijacker. # EgyptAir — EGYPTAIR (@ EGYPTAIR) March 29, 2016
It turns out the lone hijacker, identified as Egyptian Seif Eldin Mustafa, was not even wearing a real explosive belt but may have wanted to contact his former wife, a Cypriot national, or call for the release of Egyptian female prisoners.
While the details of his motives remain sketchy, netizens are relieved the incident is not related to terrorism, especially that committed by Muslims.
In the early hours of the drama, authorities claimed that another man had hijacked the plane, raising speculations about his nationality and motives.
Syrian blogger S. Rifai tweets about the confusion:
"Please don't be Syrian"
"please don't be Lebanese"
"Pls Pls don't be Palestinian"
My FB right now # EgyptAir — S. Rifai (@ THE _ 47th) March 29, 2016
While many may be relieved the hijacker wasn't from their country, more are happy the incident has nothing to do with terrorism or Islam.
Officials said that the hijacker appeared to be unstable and ruled out terrorism.
And photojournalist Patrick Baz jovially tweets:
We can finally celebrate the first Arab Muslim hijacker who is not declared a terrorist but a psychologically unstable person.:) # EgyptAir — patrickbaz (@ Patrick _ Baz) March 29, 2016
But Islam got some bashing nevertheless.
How come every time an ignorant person do something so radical the first thing you blame is islam? # egyptair https: / / t.co / Avq0BYnAWT — Mohamed (@ ALaraimi92) March 29, 2016
And journalist Mohamed El Dahshan still wants to see justice met.
He tweets:
Now, seriously though: "not terrorism"??
I hope he gets the maximum possible penalty.

The city of Cusco, Peru, was once at the center of the Incan Empire.
Today, thousands of tourists flock each day to catch a glimpse of what remains of that history in the stone walls in the city center, as well as at ancient temples and archeological sites.
Physical monuments aren't the only bridge the city has to its past.
Quechua was spoken back then, and is still alive and well today.
Wander the streets of Cusco or the surrounding communities and you'll hear residents proudly chatting away in the ancient language, which is now protected by modern public policies.
This backdrop of linguistic pride and promotion made Cusco an ideal site for the latest installment of the Gatherings of Indigenous Language Digital Activism in Latin America.
Held over the course of two days on December 11-12, 2015, this event aimed to forge connections between young indigenous activists using digital media to revitalize their native language.
It was the third such gathering, with earlier versions held in Oaxaca, Mexico and Bogotá, Colombia.
The event was co-organized by Global Voices through its Rising Voices initiative.
Other co-organizers and partners including the Bartolome de las Casas Center (CBC), the Peruvian Ministry of Culture (Indigenous Language Directorate and Cusco Cultural Directorate), the Living Tongues Institute, and Mozilla Nativo. The event took place at La Casa Campesina, a conference center of the CBC located in the historical center of Cusco.
The gathering was also made possible in part through the support of Hivos.
"Gathering of Indigenous Language Digital Activism".

Participants
In mid-October, organizers published an open call inviting interested individuals from Peru already working to revitalize their native language through Internet-based tools to apply.
Participants were selected with geographic and linguistic diversity in mind; a commitment to sharing what they would learn with their own communities was also important.
Unsurprisingly, Quechua applicants were the most represented among the applicant pool, although interest poured in from different regions in the country, including the Amazon, the Andes, and the Altiplano.
Applicants demonstrated the commitment through their community-based projects, including a digital television show, audio podcasting, poetry, oral traditions documentation, and social media.
Following a thorough review, the selection committee chose 25 people to take part in the two-day event.
Plenary sessions, workshops, and public events

Organizers led the group discussions by introducing a topic, such as linguistic or technical challenges in using native languages on the Web, community rights when sharing information online, and partnerships public and grassroots organizations to increase the impact of activism.
Following a short presentation, participants shared their ideas and own personal experiences with the topic in a conversation-like setting.
Participants also introduced their own personal projects and gathered feedback from their colleagues.
These included audio podcast interviews in Quechua, an oral storytelling documentation project in the Shipibo-Konibo language, and an activity created GIFs in many of Peru's languages.
Mentors also shared their own projects, such as the Talking Dictionaries from the Living Tongues Institute, the Languages Sound Map from the Ministry of Culture, Mozilla's localization efforts, and the Rimasun Quechua Podcasts from New York University, among others.

When it came to interactive workshops, participants chose one workshop to spend approximately six hours in over the course of the two days, instead of several 90-minute workshops like in past gatherings.
This change allowed attendees to delve deeper into a specific digital tool and be able to create a concrete product at the end of the event.
While many participants commented that they would have liked to learn all of the tools or platforms offered, it allowed them to leave the workshop with more experience that can be applied when they returned home.
Participants chose from among the following workshops: Audio podcasting Digital video Blogs Free software localization Stop-motion animation
A public forum co-organized by Global Voices and the CBC called “Internet in My Language — Experiences of Peruvian Indigenous Language Digital Activists ” was held on the evening of the first day.
Free and open to the public, the forum was an opportunity for workshop participants to interact with the general public to help raise awareness about the topic.
Next steps
With two days of networking, skills-building, and inspiration drawn from their fellow participants, the 25 attendees reflected upon their recent experience during the closing session.
Many said they were motivated to do more for their language and culture with the opportunities provided by technology.
Participants also indicated that they wanted to stay in touch through virtual platforms, such as through the gatherings private and public Facebook groups.
The interviews were filmed during the digital video workshop led by Ch'aska Rojas-Böttger.
These gatherings demonstrate that innovative work is taking place on a grassroots level, but there is still need for technical, linguistic, and community support.
The challenge remains finding meaningful ways to connect these young indigenous language digital activists.
Building a network for them is a step in the right direction.
Global Voices hopes to continue to co-organize more workshops in 2016 by seeking partnerships with local organizations that share this mission of deepening the impact of these young digital activists's work.
Incredible Cloudscape almost inspired me as an abstract-impressionist-artist.
They were mammatus clouds, whose name come from the Latin mamma, meaning "udder" or "breast".
The clouds can often signal a coming storm.
It wasn't the first sighting of the strange patterned clouds. Since the April earthquake wreaked havoc in Nepal last year, it was the second incidence.
@ KarnaSakya yes they are mammatus clouds, has been spotted twice since # earthquake from # Kathmandu following the dust storms, coincidence? — Prabhakar Shrestha (@ prabshr) April 19, 2016
Social media users were soon busy sharing beautiful pictures of the clouds:
Let's hope these mammatus clouds don't surprise us as EQ clouds... as the storm that was experienced was not that big... thanku for the important pics Paldup! Check out the EQ cloud theory at

Some well-wishers from abroad were worried about any bad omen the clouds might carry.

Is this child marriage?

Tent vendors in the western Indian state of Rajasthan are taking a stand against child marriage.
More than 47,000 of them have declared that they will not supply tents for ceremonies where children figure as the bride or groom and will ask for birth certificates to ensure ages.
If they find out that a child marriage is taking place, they say they will inform local police.
As in other parts of the world, child marriage is a grave problem in India.
The Child Marriage Act of 2006 bans the practice, fixing the legal age of marriage to 18 for girls and 21 for boys.
Despite this, India ranks 13 in the Child Marriage Hot Spots report by the International Centre For Research On Women.
The government is taking many steps to curb child marriage, including announcing incentives to delay marriages.
However, in villages with poor economic conditions, girls are often married off before the legal age because it means one less mouth to feed in the family.
Secret footage recently released of a five-year-old girl crying as she's forced to wed an 11-year-old boy in a mass ceremony in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, has caused massive outrage on social media.
Online, people applauded the tent vendors' announcement and spoke out against child marriage.
Kiran Agarwal commented on Facebook that the community must work together to condemn this ancient practice:
How can we call ourselves progressive where such evil custom of society thrives.
We all shall be vigilante in our respective localities so that our local authorities can take necessary steps to curb it.
And Mimu Chakraborty wrote:
India will call developed country on that day when they will think about child education not about her marriage after birth of a girl child

Shan State ’ s upland areas are typically cooler than the arid regions of central and lower Myanmar, although this year, much like the rest of the country, it has suffered from an unusually powerful El Niño weather pattern.
In southern Shan State, springs and lakes used by local communities to store rainwater for domestic as well as farming purposes have been dry since February, leaving many villagers facing water shortages that are even worse than those in previous years. Tun Kyi, the head of Kalaw Township ’ s Le Gaung Village, explains the situation in their area:

Relaves.org is a group whose mission is to make the Chilean government take responsibility for abandoned mine tailings (ore waste of mines) and promote their mitigation.
Lately, the group has been drawing attention to the case of Andacollo, a mining city and region of about 10,000 inhabitants in northern Chile. According to the group's website, Andacollo "was declared an 'area saturated with contamination' by particulate matter PM10 in 2009.
YouTube user Bastian Salfate uploaded a video made by students from the Journalism School of the Universidad de la Serena featuring interviews with Andacollo locals about the regional mining issue. When asked about the overall impact of mining, one Andacollo resident answers:
negative.
Because it doesn't leave any benefits here.
They buy everything elsewhere.
The people of Andacollo haven't seen any benefits.
Another resident points out the origins on the mining companies:
People expect a lot from mining, but unfortunately we can't anymore Because here the mining companies, so they say, they've bought up all of Andacollo.
And what good is that to us?
None at all.
The companies are Canadian.
What value does that have for us?
I don't know.
Mining is a complicated issue in this region, and some companies are declaring bankruptcy and laying off workers in Andacollo, threatening a local economy that relies heavily on this industry.
But the problem of mining waste isn't limited to Andacollo.
There are approximately 449 tailing deposits in Chile according to 2010 figures, and it's estimated that mining companies in the country produce around 1,400,000 tonnes of waste every day.
We should also remember the case of the El Soldado mine, where a deposit of toxic tailings collapsed after an earthquake in March 1965.
More than 200 people died and hundreds of kilometres were contaminated by the waste.

From the first hours after the news of the Orlando massacre broke, in which a shooter named Omar Mateen killed 49 people and injured 53 others in an act of hatred of LGBTQ people, it was clear that most of the men and women who died that day were Latin Americans.
For Puerto Ricans, the tragedy is perhaps even greater.
Orlando is home to one of the largest Puerto Rican communities in the United States, having been for decades a popular destination for those who emigrated looking for better employment opportunities and a better quality of life for their families.
One of the reasons many Puerto Ricans give for emigrating to the US is precisely to find a safer neighborhood to live in, due to the increase of violent crimes in Puerto Rico over the past years.
Doubtless, many of the people who were killed emigrated there looking for a better life and probably felt they were safer.
Writing for non-profit news site 80 grados, Puerto Rican queer activist Yoryie Irizarry explained why the pain of these deaths is felt so strongly among the LGBTQ community:
For many of us, the club is a safer place than our family home.
It was in a club that I discovered, surprised and excited, that men can dance with other men, and women with other women.
It was in a club where many of us learned to dance with each other, seduce each other and touch each other without fear of being judged by anyone.
It is in a club where we "let our hair down," freed of the ideological and patriarchal corset that dictates each and every allowed movement and expression according to the genitals.
For many of us the discotheque represents a safe space that protects us during traditional holidays.
In the club we are free to be who we are.
That is why this homophobic attack on our brothers and sisters in Orlando feels so personal.
We know the ties of friendship, sensuality and love that unite us in the bar, the fraternal experiences, the jokes, the music that we share when we dance and laugh, free to be who we are, far from the judging glare of those who hate us.
Early on when the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the victims were still largely unconfirmed, Facebook user Nelie Lebrón Robles made the following poignant observation about an angle that has remained unexplored in mainstream media as of this writing:
At the end of the day, not only the gay community, but the Latino and especially Puerto Rican communities, will have been protagonists among the victims of this tragedy in Orlando.
And then I ask myself, shouldn't the predominant nationality of the victims be a factor to take into consideration?
This occurred on Latino Night in the nightclub Pulse.
Without having divulged officially the names of all the deceased, we know of three Puerto Rican victims...
All speak of the obvious: anti-gay hate crime, radical Islamic terrorism...
But we haven't heard the possibility that the victims could also have been chosen for their Latino origins. Mateen's motives haven't been confirmed, and what is known paints a complicated picture.
So far, there is no evidence that Mateen was under the direction of any extremist group, though he had been investigated by the FBI for having previously claimed ties to groups like ISIS, the al Nusra Front (an affiliate of al Qaeda) and Hezbollah.
But, as has been pointed out, this is confusing because these groups are in conflict with each other.
Authorities believe that the likely explanation is that Mateen was self-radicalized.
People who knew him have told the press he had anger issues and was homophobic, racist and misogynistic.
Mateen, however, was seen many times previously at Pulse nightclub, the site of the shooting, which is a popular gay club.
He also had reportedly used a gay dating app, suggesting that perhaps his own internal conflicts about his sexuality were part of what drove him to commit such horrific violence.
Regardless of motives, the fact is mass shootings have become disturbingly frequent in the United States, and a common thread among them has been the attackers' easy access to firearms.
The US must take a hard, honest look at itself on where it stands on this issue if future tragedies like this one are to be prevented.
Ataturk Airport wikipedia image.
At least 42 people have died following shooting and a triple suicide bombing at Ataturk, Istanbul, one of Europe's busiest airports and a hub for global air traffic.
The attacks carried out by at least three assailants began late on June 29 and were preliminarily attributed to the ISIS radical group by Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.
The fact the attacks took place in one of the world's most transited airports meant that global media and citizen media coverage of the aftermath was almost instant:

According to their data, the frightened sheep began to scatter, and 145 animals fell into the precipice The Commission for Civil Protection and the Aksy district department of the Ministry of Emergency situations are carrying out an assessment on the ground.
Under comedian Nurlan Anarbayev's Facebook post on the topics, the jokes rolled in:

Someone clearly asked the cosmos to rid us of 120 sheep. Azamat Mamytkhan Not those 120 sheep, a different 120 sheep!
Bakyt Moldozhanov Is this a sort of warning from above?
Like, next time, instead of the sheep it will be? The lack of sympathy for the sheep and their shepherd is alarming, but antipathy towards lawmakers is perfectly understandable.
In six years of working under a system in which its constitutional mandate has been expanded, the legislature has done little to endear itself to the public, with MPs championing frivolous legislation as well as the more serious kind that represses fundamental rights.
To their credit lawmakers were thoughtful enough to sacrifice several sheep in 2011 in a bid to drive evil spirits out of government, but it didn't work. Corruption in the country remains pervasive at all levels.

Entries to a photo contest called "The Voice of the Lake" showing lush scenery, majestic wildlife and discarded man-objects at Lake Ohrid, which straddles Albania and Macedonia, have recently sparked interest among many Macedonians.
The contest was organized by the Citizen Initiative OhridSOS, which is fighting to stop harmful urbanization projects that threaten to destroy the magnificent lake, which is the largest natural lake in Macedonia and the oldest lake on the European continent.

Each year in early summer in Japan, if you're lucky you'll catch a glimpse of fireflies in late May and early June.
Fireflies (Japan is home to the Asian firefly, Luciola parvula) require clean, running water, and have long been a associated with rice paddies, which are flooded in Japan each May.
However, as Japan's farming population ages and rice fields are turned into subdivisions, there are fewer chances to see fireflies every year.
As part of a photography contest held by Tokyo Camera Club in June 2016, a number of photographers submitted amazing and surreal photographs of fireflies from around Japan.
"Genji and sweet sedge duet."
Submissions to Tokyo Camera Club photo contests can be followed on Instagram with the hashtag # 東京カメラ部.
Honoré Kahi, a professor at Alassane Ouattara University in Bouaké, has become a social media celebrity after strapping the baby of one of his students to his back so that the mother could continue to focus on the class.
Below are his comments when contacted by French television:
It's quite common for young women to bring their children to class. But that day, this student's baby would not stop crying.
She left the room three times to try to calm him, to no success.
After half an hour, I told her that it was a very important class for her future and that, for me, she needed to give it her full attention. So I offered to help.
So, I strapped the child to my back.
Immediately, he fell quiet, soothed by my movements back and forth across the room as I continued with my class. He even went to sleep!
I was able to continue with my class for nearly three quarters of an hour without any interruption. My student told me that she was very touched by my gesture and that she was surprised because there is generally a certain distance between teachers and students.
I'm frankly surprised that this gesture has received so much attention, because it was really spontaneous.
The students took photos because they found it funny: in our collective imagination, we associate carrying a baby on your back in this way with an African 'Mama' … It's quite rare to see a man do that, let alone a teacher.
I've had people from France, Côte d ’ Ivoire and Mali get in touch to tell me that the pictures have made them smile.
I think that what a teacher does to create social links with their students is just as important as the content of their classes.
Adel Al-Jaf, known by his stage name "Adel Euro."

This article by Lucy Martirosyan originally appeared on PRI.org on July 6, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.
The moonwalk was easy for him.
He could mimic almost all of Michael Jackson's moves.
But Adel Al-Jaf, known by his stage name "Adel Euro," would have to dance in isolation while living in Iraq.
But men who sing and dance are judged differently in Iraq, Al-Jaf said in an interview with the BBC in 2015.
They're derided as feminine, weak or homosexual. His parents warned him that his breakdancing and rapping could lead him into trouble.
Al-Jaf was one of the 250 people killed in the Baghdad bomb attack claimed by the ISIS militant group on July 3 at the district.
"They told me what I'm doing could be dangerous in Iraq — because this is not our culture," Al-Jaf said in that 2015 interview. "I cannot be dancing in the street or doing these moves outside.
They said that this will bring you more trouble in your life.
There is no future for this art, for this thing or this hobby you like in Iraq. "
Al-Jaf kept dancing, singing and rapping anyway.
He would choose isolated areas within parks to practice his moves.
When the police would stop him, he'd say he wasn't dancing, he was performing martial arts — a more masculine and therefore more acceptable physical activity for Al-Jaf to practice.
Through YouTube and Skype, he would receive feedback on his dancing from Jonathan Hollander, the founder of a New York dance group, Battery Dance.
Al-Jaf later performed with Battery Dance in the Jordanian capital of Amman.
This was Al-Jaf's first time performing in front of an audience.
Here's the video of his first performance.
When he returned from Jordan to Iraq, Al-Jaf said he fell into a depression.
"In our culture, they'll fight these kind of hobbies.
A man who dances is not a real man, "he said.
But he pushed himself to keep dancing anyway, despite the negative connotations his society had with men and dancing. "One day I'll leave Iraq and go to a place where people love dancing and they're not fighting it."
Languages and cultures may differ, but the joyful sound of children singing is universal.
A song called "Marrin Gamu," created for primary school children and teachers to promote the diversity and beauty of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, is proving just that.
The title of the song combines the word for "body" in two of the languages.
Marrin is the word for "body" in the Wiradjuri language of New South Wales, and Gamu is the word for "body" in the Kalaw Kawaw Ya language from the Torres Strait.
The song is also the basis of a friendly contest organized by First Languages Australia and ABC Splash.
First, communities are invited to teach local children the lyrics in English.

Then once the children know the song, the community is asked to translate the lyrics into their own native language.
Finally, the community and school work together to create a video to be uploaded to the competition website.
The Marrin Gamu website provides an example to help get teachers and students started.
Also included in the website is a range of Australian curriculum-linked classroom activities developed around the project.
Conversation starter questions are suggested as a way to facilitate discussions with students about their language:
Questions for the class:
Are their any similarities between the body words in the languages in the video and your language?
Is there any reason the song cannot be directly translated into your language?
What might you do to overcome this?
The project will run for the next two years so that all schools have time to develop the necessary relationships to participate in the project.
Contest organizers hope to see "Marrin Gamu" sung in many of Australia ’ s hundreds of first languages.
"Marrin Gamu" fits into a broader strategy to prevent language loss by focusing on schools and students and working with local teachers.
Many teachers do not have deep knowledge of these languages, so the website shares cross-curricular programs for use in the classroom.
Incorporating an element of digital media and the internet may motivate students when they see their creativity and local language reflected online.

The first submission is a video created by a school in Queensland in which students sing "Marrin Gamu" in the Gurang language.
As more videos of the song are submitted, we'll be sharing them here.
Serbian politicians Ivica Dačić and Dragan Marković Palma enjoying the summer.
Photo by anonymous author first posted on the Facebook page "Neguj mo srpski jezik" ("Nurture Serbian Language") on July 26, 2016.
A photo of two Serbian politicians riding a motorcycle together has gone viral across social media.
The portal Nova energija ("New Energy") published an overview of the hype:
Two friends on a motorbike would make a usual summer photo with hot asphalt.
However, when one considers who these two friends are, the photo becomes very unusual.
The photo from unknown source, showing Ivica Dačić, minister of foreign affairs of Serbia, and Dragan Marković Palma, the mayor of Jagodina, has been making the rounds on Facebook for days now.
It was soon used as a basis for memes. On the website 9gag.com, and all over Facebook, Dačić and Palma ride through different situations, from Pokemon Go to Game of Thrones, and riding dragons.
Dačić and Palma, Akira-style.
Various memes quickly found the way from Facebook and Twitter to the pages of news portals. The Internet exploded with photo shops of our local politicians riding a bike.https: / / t.co / KTFPudnnEe
DAČIĆ I PALMA ISKOČILI I NA @ 9GAG — Kamiondzija ♐ (@ KoleMali) July 27, 2016
Ivica Dačić, the leader of Socialist Party of Serbia, and Dragan Marković Palma, a member of parliament and the leader of the party United Serbia, are coalition partners.
Recently, Palma proposed that Dačić become the presidential candidate for their coalition in the 2017 elections. Dačić and Palma broke the Internet!
(Photo) The only thing better than Dačić and Palma on a moped are Dačić and Palma on a moped in space. With lasers.
Twitter user @ slonoxy even made it easier for aspiring meme authors:
If you would like to make Dačić / Palma photo montages, here's the photo layer with a transparent background.

Pokémon Go has not been officially released in China, but Chinese players are finding creative ways to access the record-breaking augmented reality game, which has captured the imaginations of millions of mobile users around the world.
The game uses Google Maps data to superimpose characters from the Japanese Pokémon video game series into your geographic surroundings.
As you walk, your smartphone uses GPS to track your position in the world, and it will know if you get close to one of these characters.
You can then capture the character on your phone screen, train it, and then deploy it in the “augmented reality ” battlefield that is Pokémon Go.
Launched on Apple's App store in select countries on July 6, 2016, it was developed by US-based Niantic Labs.
The game is technically 'unavailable' in China's App store, but some people have found ways to download and play it anyway.
Since Pokémon Go has yet to receive such approval, fans have to register their phone with an overseas Apple ID in order to find and download the Pokémon Go app.
2.
To register a gamer account, players need a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to climb over the Chinese Internet filter or the so-called Great Firewall and access the game server.
3.
Most players have to spoof their GPS location.
Since the game's GPS features are locked in most part of the country, players have to spoof their GPS location.
In early July, many Chinese players set their location to Australia, leading to numerous server problems.
4.
A few players use the game for making patriotic statements.
After the game launched in Japan on July 22, Chinese players spoofed their location again, which resulted in some technical problems.
Moreover, a few of them used the game for making political statements.
According to TechAsia, Pokémon Go's Japanese servers have reportedly been flooded with Chinese players, and one of them appeared at the Yasukuni Shrine, a politically sensitive site honoring those who died serving the Emperor of Japan during wars from 1867 – 1951:
A post that reached the top of Reddit ’ s massive Pokémon Go subreddit, for example, complained about high-level Chinese players monopolizing Japan ’ s Pokémon gyms.
Some even used the game as a form of nationalist protest.
A photo posted with the Reddit thread shows the gym at the Yasukuni Shrine being dominated by a player with a high-level Dragonite nicknamed “Long live China! ”
As the Yasukuni Shrine is a well-known location among Chinese, it is quite natural for Chinese players to visit the site.
Though only a small number of players would use the game to make political statements, such an act is likely to attract a large amount of attention, as well as generate antipathy between people in the virtual world and fuel extreme nationalistic reactions in the real world.
5.
Pokémon characters roam free in Xinjiang and Dongbei.
The game is not as much fun if you cannot actually interact with the real world environment.
In some parts of China, including Xinjiang and the Northeastern region (Dongbei), the game's GPS has not been locked and players can actually capture Pokémon characters there.
Of course, if you are not a local resident, you have to travel there to play the game.
One gamer named @ chekailiuhai shared some tips on playing the augmented game in Dongbei on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo:
Chinese gamers can face significant political risks.
As some has pointed out on Weibo, using a VPN in Xinjiang can result in mobile services being cut off completely.

Chinese gamers can face significant political risks.
As some has pointed out on Weibo, using a VPN in Xinjiang can result in mobile services being cut off completely.
Also, since the game launched on July 6, a conspiracy theory about Pokémon Go has been circulated on social media, claiming the game is a US government-sponsored project aimed at collecting sensitive geo data.
For example, on July 25 the Communist Youth League from Henan province posted an article on Weibo quoting various sources commenting on the companies behind the game's GPS technology:
However, the GPS technology of the game comes from CIA and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
These organizations are not charities and I can induce that the game developer will hand over the geo-data in exchange for the game's technology.
On July 11, the three provinces in Dongbei and Xinjiang unlocked the game's GPS, some players claimed that some characters are located only a yard from the Shenyang military base.
Dongbei is a region where there is a large number of military organizations and Xinjiang is a sensitive region.
Why were these areas the first to unlock in China?
According to a local gamer, @ lizexipablo, Dongbei and Xinjiang were 'not unlocked' on July 11. He says he has been accessing the game since its launch. He elaborated that the game developers have drawn a GPS locked zone according to this map:
Even though the conspiracy has little evidence backing it up, as geolocation technology is used in many mobile apps, it still received some echoes online.
Charles Liu from Nanfang quoted a netizen comment from Weibo:
Then, when war breaks out, Japan and the US can easily target their guided missiles, and China will have been destroyed by the invasion of a Japanese-American game.
Given the spread of extreme patriotic sentiment targeting foreign brands, Chinese gamers playing Pokémon Go may also risk being labelled traitors and subjected to bullying or attacks online or offline.
All this raises the question: Is there a safe way to play Pokémon Go in China? Under such political circumstances, the safest way to play the game is to spoof your location and hope that others think you are 'performing patriotism' on overseas servers. However, given the massive population of Chinese gamers, the minority of nationalist trolls has already caused resentment and anger in other countries.
The most reasonable solution is to wait for an official launch of the game inside China. Niantic Labs is also applying for the game ’ s trademarks in China.
But ordinary netizens don't think Chinese authorities will let the game enter the country.
A Chinese Twitter user explained:
I think Pokémon Go should be locked in mainland China.
Just imagine one day Nintendo's server had some technical problem and released a Mewtwo at Tiananmen Square. Then a large number of gamers would chase after Mewtwo carrying Xiaome's mobile chargers.
Do you think the police officers would believe that they were chasing after the characters?
They would think that the group of people were about to launch a terrorist attack!

Screenshot from full-length advert uploaded on Shoro's Youtube channel.
The Maksym Shoro beverage produced by ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan's leading soft drinks producer Shoro is not everybody's cup of tea, but those that love the salty fermented drink truly love it.
But Shoro has retained the nomadic identity associated with its homeland, as the company's latest advert shows.
Below is the advert in full as well as a translation of the message the company posted on Facebook to mark its arrival:
One day early in the morning a brave Kyrgyz guy rode out on his trusty steed to the neighbouring meadow.
He heard that a beautiful woman who had won the hearts of many champions had lived there.
In Kyrgyzstan, there is an ancient game - Kyz Kuumai.
If the guy can catch the girl, then he will kiss her.
If not, the girl will strike him with a whip, and the rider will lose face before the people.
But, if the guy pleases the girl, she can quietly give in to him. After all, as our ancestors always said, do not ask for a quick horse, ask for a safe journey.
A version of this story, by Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi and Karina Lester, Mobile Language Team, was first published as a case study on First Languages Australia's guide "Warra: Building teams, building resources."
Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi (KWP), a group of community members, teachers, linguists and language enthusiasts who are teaching the Kaurna language of the Kaurna people, the original inhabitants of the Adelaide Plains area in South Australia, is creating online video lessons for language revitalization.
The Kaurna ‘ Lessons ’ series currently runs to eight episodes.
Two charismatic presenters and members of the Kaurna community, Jack Kanya Buckskin and Taylor Tipu Power-Smith, are the public faces of this project.
In the lessons, Buckskin says some basic greetings, vocabulary words and phrases of the Kaurna language and explains their meanings.
In this video, Buckspin and his friends highlight some of the more commonly used terminology in the sport, such as words for kicking, hand balling, and bending.
Animal puppets also make an appearance teaching words and singing songs in the local language.
This program called "Pirltawardl" or "The Possum's House" features characters such as Kuula the Koala and Pirlta the Possum.
When KWP was first looking to create online resources for language vitalization, they settled on video as the medium, since they already counted enthusiastic people with video production skills as part of the group.
With this existing video production knowledge, the language team looked at the different options for video language resources, such as documentary, drama, educational, etc., and decided a series of language lessons would be the most useful community tool.
The project is a collaboration with the Department of Linguistics in the School of Humanities at the University of Adelaide and is funded by the Australian Government Indigenous Language and Arts program.
While the videos are publicly available online and accessible by anyone, KWP hopes that viewers will treat the language with the same reverence that community members do.
A statement on the KWP website states:
Kaurna language and culture is the property of the Kaurna community.
Users of this site are urged to use the language with respect.
This means making every effort to get the pronunciation, spelling and grammar right.
Kaurna people reserve the right to monitor the use of the language in public.
Users of this site should consult with Kaurna people about use of the language in the public domain.
Accessing fun and interactive videos is an ideal way to reach young and old alike, and the response has been favorable.
Karina Lester, from the South Australian Mobile Language Team, said in an interview:
A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar on August 24.
Image showing the epicenter and extent of the earthquake is from the website of the U.S. Geological Survey
Myanmar authorities reported that three people were killed and at least 228 temples and pagodas have been damaged in the whole of Mandalay after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the country on August 24.
Among the damaged structures were 187 brick temples in the ancient capital of Bagan.
This is a setback for the country ’ s bid to recognize Bagan as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Bagan is among Southeast Asia ’ s important archaeological sites, and they are often compared to Cambodia ’ s Angkor Wat and Indonesia ’ s Borobudur.
Bagan, which is also a popular tourism destination, has almost 3,000 pagodas and temples.
The last time an earthquake destroyed Bagan temples was in 1975.
The powerful earthquake was felt not just in Myanmar but also in the neighboring countries of Bangladesh and Thailand.
Myanmar is already cleaning the debris left behind by the earthquake.
Many are clamoring for the quick restoration of the ruined temples, but there are also those who want to preserve some of the damage in order to remind the people about the need to prepare for disasters.
Independent news website and Global Voices partner The Irrawaddy has documented the impact of the earthquake in Mandalay.
Below are some photos which show the destruction in some of Myanmar ’ s famous Bagan temples:

As music is one of the most influential cultural elements in most Ugandans' lives, it is no surprise that the Ugandan music industry has grown from strength to strength over the years.
What might be more surprising is that politicians, soldiers and police officers have all flirted with professional music careers.
In 1981 Uganda had its first commercially successful singing army officer, Sergeant Kifulugunyu.
His music motivated many army officers in the bush war that brought current President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni to power.
By the early 1990s Sergeant Kifulugunyu was one of the most heralded artists in the country.
In the video below, Sergeant Kifulugunyu talks to NTV Uganda about his experience with music both during the war and after the war.
He is one of a number of Ugandan artists who are concerned about plagiarism. Local artist Gravity Omutujju re-did Kifulugunyu's song "Kibonge" and renamed it "Omwoto" without his permission, he says.
Other security officers who have joined the contemporary music industry include Afande Karangwa and Afande Mia and Afande OJ from the police force.
The latter duo's music is entirely about patriotism and civil work, mainly that of the police.
One of their recent sleekly shot videos is "Kaazi Yetu", Swahili for "Our Job".
In it the duo speak about the work of the police, citing and thanking different people including President Yoweri Museveni, Inspector General of Police, General Kale Kayihura and others.
Their videos have been shared by several YouTube and Facebook users, and each has commanded over 10,000 views.
Readers of Uganda's Daily Monitor website have mixed feelings, with some excited and others criticising the actions of the officers singing and dancing whilst still in police uniform. Nyaralego is excited that the officers are putting the guns aside and having a good time:
(Ndombolo ya solo refers to a popular Congolese music genre and dance style). Ug _ Ug feels the officers are breaking the police code of conduct:
The Police worldwide has code of conduct, some of which e.g. never to drink alcohol publicly when on duty in Police uniform; as equally as it ’ s a misconduct dancing in uniform in public places without any orderly authorization from above.
These boys should have been incarcerated on the spot, but it seems M7 ´ s Police are as ignorant of their own code of conduct as Himself from the above!
The videos were produced and released with the approval of the police force, who contributed US $5,000 towards production.
Ajigak is happy for the officers and advises them to commercialize their music more often to augment their miserly police salaries.
Good to be creative to supplement the meager pay earned by the police force other than the greedy politicians.
Bravo officer, you need to commercialize your music to make more earning.
The drone's launch was part of an investigation by Eyes on the Forest Indonesia (EOF), a coalition of three environment groups which was established in 2004 to study the recurring forest fires.
According to EOF, the video gave proof that 3,000 hectares of land allegedly owned by plantation company Andika Permata Sawit Lestari (APSL) were ‘ deliberately burned ’.
The video can be used as an additional evidence against the company, which is facing charges of land grabbing and operating without a proper license.
In recent months, the Indonesian government has stepped up its efforts to stop forest fires in Riau, the ‘ ground zero ’ of the haze disaster.
It vowed to prosecute companies responsible for the forest fires.
It also urged Malaysia and Singapore to probe the companies in their countries which are funding the expansion of palm oil plantations in Indonesia.
Early this month, seven employees of the government ’ s environment ministry investigating a fire incident were hostaged by scores of individuals who were assumed to be employees of a plantation company.
They were released after the police intervened and only after they deleted photos and videos of what they documented in the area.
The EOF said the drone video confirmed what the employees were investigating.
As Indonesia pursues its probe about the issue, haze continues to plague the country and its neighbors.
Watch the drone video that exposes the burning of land in Indonesia:

A Japanese artist is using traditional artisanal craft techniques to create compelling bamboo insects that have developed a devoted following online.
Uses chikusei (bamboo crafting), Noriyuki Saitoh uploads photos of his insects to social media and to his website.
He also tweets images of his intricately detailed bamboo insects, which are typically shared and reposted hundreds of times.
For a good selection of Saitoh's bamboo insect creations, see his most recent Twitter New Year's card, addressed to his followers, with photos of bamboo paper wasps, a mantis, a beetle, damselflies and a cicada:
Thanks for all of your follows, RTs, and likes over the past year.
You all inspire me to do everything I do.
Detailed photo essays of Saitoh's creations can also be found on his Facebook page.
Saitoh is careful to point out that his creations are intended to be art, rather than accurate models of insects:
My insect creations are not intended to be realistic.
Since I'm not using specimens or replicas. I'm not aiming for accuracy in proportion, but instead I'm focused on the detail, impression of, and feel of the bamboo insect.
While the bamboo insects may not be entirely accurate, the skillful attention to detail elevates the bamboo creations:
(･ㅂ･) و ̑ ̑ The paper wasps are complete!!
I have uploaded to my website: https: / / t.co / KoPEwTWGJu
On YouTube, Saitoh has also shared a video showing how he made his dragonfly wings:
Kuşköy local.
Screenshot taken from Eurasianet video.
The following is a photo and audio partner post from EurasiaNet.org written by Alexander Christie-Miller. Republished with permission.
Follow link for photo and audio.
In most ways, Kuşköy resembles countless other villages nestled in the Pontic Mountains along Turkey ’ s Black Sea coast. Its 500 or so residents cultivate tea and hazelnuts; there is one street with a baker, a butcher, and a few cafes.
It is the sounds, not the sights, that make Kuşköy different.
For generations, villagers have conversed using a unique form of whistled communication they call “kuş dili, ” or“ bird language ” in Turkish.
The name Kuşköy itself means “bird village. ”“ Come over here for some tea! ”
Ibrahim Kodalak calls to his neighbor as he stands outside his home, which clings to a sheer hillside far above a valley.
The 45-year-old hazelnut farmer is “speaking ” in a series of earsplitting, warbling whistles that really do resemble bird song.
In fact, according to Kodalak, the melodies of local birds are often similar to kuş dili; a morning song of the blackbird is the same as a famous verse in the Quran, he claims.
“Electricity only came here in 1986, and before that it was hard to communicate over long distances; we really needed bird language, ” Kodalak said, reverting to Turkish.
Like other forms of whistled communication, kuş dili arose in a region where the rugged ground and sparse population made travel difficult even over short distances.
A whistle can reverberate for more than a kilometer, according to Kodalak.
“If you can ’ t make your voice heard over a long distance, you could also make a chain with different people relaying the message. ”
Most villagers believe kuş dili arose about 400 years ago, although no one knows for sure.
The “language ” is, in fact, a whistled dialect of Turkish, with each syllable rendered in one of about 20 different sounds.
Typical subjects include invitations to tea or to help with work, notifying neighbors about the arrival of a truck to pick up the harvest, or announcements of funerals, births and weddings.
The slow process of modernization in the village helped preserve kuş dili, but, in recent decades – particularly since the arrival of cell phones – the language has been in decline, said Kuşköy ’ s mukhtar, or village headman, Metin Köçek.
“Now we have roads, electricity and phone lines, ” Köçek said.
“In our childhood, the bird language was used a lot in daily life.
Now we meet the same needs by using a cell phone. ”
Technology is not the only threat.
As in other parts of rural Turkey, many young people are leaving Kuşköy in search of better opportunities in the country ’ s booming cities.
“Lack of opportunities is a general problem in our area, ” commented Mehmet Fatih Kara, the governor of Canakçı district, within which Kuşköy is situated.
“Young people go and leave the elderly behind, and only visit on vacation. ”
For the past 15 years, the village has held an annual festival to promote the language.
There are whistling displays, and a contest between the finest whistlers, in which they relay instructions to each over the valley before a panel of judges.
“Our purpose is to promote bird language to our country and to the world, ” said Şeref Köçek, organizer of the festival, and head of the village ’ s Bird Language Association.
Around 2,000 people attended this year ’ s festival, on July 8, which had an emphasis more on local music and dancing than on whistling.
Almost all were from the nearby area, or were relatives who had returned specially for the festival.
Kara believes that kuş dili could be used as a means of boosting the local economy and arresting the current exodus to the cities.
“I want to use tourism to turn this language into an economic source for the region, ” he said. Recently, he approached Türk Telekom, the former state-owned telecommunications company, to provide sponsorship for the festival.
Whether any of it will help reverse kuş dili ’ s slow decline remains to be seen.
But for Bird Language Association Director Seref Köçek ‘ s brother Rıfat, a 38-year-old Istanbul firefighter who terms kuş dili his “mother tongue, ” Kuşköy has a obligation to preserve its cultural heritage.“ e need to keep the language alive out of respect to our ancestors, ” he said.
“They created it, and they never knew that one day it could make us famous. ”
Little Chef Kicha on his YouTube show.
Screenshot from video.
"Anyone can cook" was the motto of famous French Chef Gusteau in the Disney animated movie "Ratatouille".
If you look at the YouTube videos of the 6-year-old Chef Nihal Raj or Kicha (his nickname) from a suburb of the coastal Indian city of Kochi, you will understand what he meant.
According to Kicha's father Rajagopal V. Krishnan, he started cooking when he was 4 years old after watching and helping his mother baking in the kitchen.
Kicha loves to have people watching him cook, so his father started filming him on his mobile phone and shared the footage on Facebook, which got appreciation from friends and families.
He later opened the YouTube channel and started uploading videos.
Kicha is encouraged by all the attention he gets and likes to reply to messages on the Facebook page for the show.
In May 2016, Facebook acquired non-exclusive rights to one of his videos for 2,000 US dollars to use for its new campaign "Space for Everyone", making him the youngest artist to sell rights to Facebook.
Here is the much discussed Mickey Mouse Mango Ice-Cream video by Little Chef Kicha picked up by Facebook:
Last month, he even went to United States to appear on the popular daytime Ellen DeGeneres talk show, the youngest Indian to do so.
The video of his appearance has almost 1.5 million views so far:
Kicha gets a lot of love from his viewers. For example, Rachel Verghese commented in Facebook:
Kicha, you were adorable on the show.
For a young six year old to be on Ellen's show was awesome and you did a great job.
What an accomplishment.
We are all proud of you.
Kicha has over 12,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel.
You can catch up on the latest about him on Twitter.
In Hong Kong, we are all sardines.
Illustration by Disillusionist (CC BY-ND 4.0) Hong Kong is notorious for its crowded living conditions and the high cost of residential housing. Generations of housing policies have promised improvements in living standards, but are yet to deliver.
The last several decades have seen the city ’ s apartments becoming smaller and more expensive.
Cage homes, rooms diced up or subdivided with boards, and the like, used to be the last resort of the city ’ s poorest.
But nowadays even dice-sized apartments can be packaged for the luxury market, as people have become desensitized to the absurdity and have resigned themselves to even more cramped living spaces at unaffordable prices.
Regardless of the type of housing we occupy, in Hong Kong we are all just sardines.
Interested in Cultural Feminism?

The OyeJuanjo blog, which is run by the young Peruvian journalist Juanjo Dioses and is known for sharing educational texts and resources, combined in a single post 70 free and downloadable pdf format works in Spanish that study and discuss different phenomenons through two lenses: feminism and culture.
Among the texts are essays, academic works and discussions concerning images of the body in culture and in politics, cyber-feminism or an analysis of the portrayal of women in comic books. The Mexican artist and an icon of women's struggle in the region and globally, Frida Kahlo, is at the centre of the analysis in many of these texts. Displays of power and of countervailing power through the body and communities on and off the internet are also explored.
In short, this is a journey through the interests of the intellectual world in the context of cultural and gender struggles.
Winter has arrived in Japan.
On Thursday, November 24, Tokyo experienced its first November snowfall in 54 years.
While the snow may have been unexpected, it does herald the start of an uncomfortable season in Japan: winter.
While the torrid summer months can be made bearable thanks to ubiquitous air conditioning, Japan's chilly winter months can be cruel. This is because central heating is not as widespread in Japan as it is in other developed countries.
Instead, many people rely on kerosene space heaters to keep warm, as well as something called a kotatsu — a low wooden table outfitted with a heavy blanket, and warmed by a heater underneath.
The word kotatsu conjures up images of coziness and warmth, and not just for humans.
House cats love the kotatsu, too, and can often be found snoozing under the table, inside the blanket, close to the electric heater.
Cats also lay claim to the warm spot in front of the kerosene heater.
The Nekobako blog captures this scene perfectly:
A screenshot of the documentary "Valley of a Thousand Hills."
"Valley of a Thousand Hills" is a recent mini documentary about Indigo Skate Camp, an effort to create the first generation of Zulu skaters in the village of Isithumba, in the Kwazulu-Natal region of South Africa.
The village is surrounded by 1,000 hills, hence the title of the film.
The camp is the brainchild of South African professional skater Dallas Oberholzer.
Skateboarding is not a common sport in South Africa, especially among blacks.
In addition to skateboarding, the 30 to 40 kids taking part in the programme are taught self-respect, health and safety, art and music.
The film is by Jess Colquhoun, a documentary filmmaker and photographer, and Huck Magazine.

Tajikistan, 93% mountainous with ethereal alpine lakes dotted all over, is a veritable shrine for nature lovers, providing they can live with the rutted roads and burdensome bureaucracy.
Because once you have paid out on a multi-connection flight to the capital Dushanbe and shelled sixty dollars or so for a tourist visa, off-the-beaten track treasures await.
Many of those who find Tajikistan on a map and decide to travel there come to climb. But for those that lack the skill and equipment for mountaineering, road trips can take you far higher than you might expect.
The Pamir Highway was listed third in the top-ten must-visit places in the former USSR in a May 2015 issue of the National Geographic Traveler and is considered by many as one of the most thrilling, edgy road trips in the world.
As the jeep rattles along the road between Dushanbe and Murghab in the east, travellers of the highway can see Afghan villages across the Amu-Darya river.
Separated from the former Soviet Union by the snaking body of water, they seem like part of another world.
At points along the way you will spot Peak Ismoil Somoni, the highest peak in the old USSR. You might then wish to pray in the remains of an ancient Zoroastrian temple and read petroglyphs.
On arrival in Murghab tourists can feast on yaks raised mostly by ethnic Kyrgyz herders.

It is the Zarafshan valley along this road that is home to some of Central Asia's most beautiful lakes.
Iskandarkul, connected by name and legend to Alexander the Great, is located at 2,195 meters above sea level.
From the right angle you can see how the lake serves as a mirror to the nature surrounding it, reflecting the fairytalish Fan peaks with startling clarity. Further along are the equally otherworldly seven lakes of Shing, sometimes called the Shing princesses.

Tajiks believe that the fabled cities of Bukhara and Samarqand are culturally theirs, but these Silk Road oases were given to Uzbekistan when the Bolsheviks started artificially carving Soviet republics into Central Asia with little reference to the national identities of the local population.
But even without the ancient pearls of Asia, as the two are sometimes called, Tajikistan has historical sites.
Hisor fortress, just 20 kilometres from the capital along a recently built highway from Dushanbe is the only ancient settlement recalling the State of Shuman, which celebrates its 3,000th anniversary this year.

Apart from semi-restored Buddhas Dushanbe contains a number of other massive things including the second biggest flagpole in the world and the biggest teahouse in the world.
Moreover, if you re-visit the country in a couple of years, you will also find the biggest mosque in Central Asia in addition to the region's biggest theater.
So, don't let the country's 109th placing from 141 countries in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness rating prepared by the World Economic Forum deter you.
Travel to Tajikistan!

Group photo of workshop participants in Cochabamba, Bolivia
According to the country ’ s Constitution, all of Bolivia ’ s 37 languages are recognized as official languages.
However, while this linguistic diversity can be observed in daily life, the same is not necessarily reflected on the internet, where Spanish remains the dominant language.
Even though digital initiatives have emerged to promote the other 36 indigenous languages, most concentrate on the languages with higher numbers of speakers like Aymara and Quechua.
Many of the other 34 languages still remain without a significant online presence driven by native speakers.
Indigenous digital activists put special emphasis on the challenge of including all Bolivian languages during a two-day workshop held in the city of Cochabamba on July 28-29, 2016.
The gathering was co-organized by Global Voices through its Rising Voices initiative in collaboration with local digital activists Gladys Camacho and Juan Carlos Romero, along with partners Jaqi Aru and Voces Indígenas Urbanas.
The event ’ s host was the Simón I. Patiño Pedagogical and Cultural Center.
This Bolivian workshop was another in the series of workshops held across the region with local partners, including previously in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.
Participants
Leading up to the workshop, a national open call for participation was put out focusing on indigenous internet users who are already working to revitalize their native languages.
Participants were chosen taking into account geographic and linguistic representation; a demonstrated commitment to sharing their knowledge and skills with their own communities was also a determining factor.
Banner for the workshop.
Approximately 50 applications were received, and as expected, Quechua and Aymara applicants were the most represented among those interested in taking part.
However, after outreach efforts especially to communities in the Bolivian Orient, participants representing Guaraní, Chácobo, Bésiro, Mojeño Trinitario, and Yurakaré communities also were selected.
In total, 25 participants were invited to take part in the two-day workshop to share their experiences, build new digital skills, and make connections with other Bolivians working towards revitalizing their native languages through the use of the internet.
Languages know no borders, so some of the indigenous languages of Bolivia are also spoken in neighboring countries.
Upon discovering the call for proposals, a group of activists from Resistencia, Argentina who speak the Qom language (or Toba as it is known in Bolivia) also requested to take part in the gathering.
Activities
The gathering ’ s primary purpose was to create a space for experience exchange among the different activists.
Over the course of two days, there were hour-long plenary sessions led by facilitators and participants that touched on linguistic and technical challenges related to language use on the web.
Another activist from El Alto, Josue Qhispi, has been uploading lessons to learn the Aymara language on his Wix site called Aymaryaya, which he also shares on his Facebook group.
Volunteer translators Victoria Tinta and Gloria Chambi spoke about their motivations for participating as editor and translator with the Global Voices in Aymara project, which provides translations of news stories from Spanish into the Aymara language.
This work also included a pilot project producing repackaged audio content of these translations for online use and with partner radio stations, such as Radio San Gabriel, which also took part in the event.
The host city of Cochabamba is considered to be one of the cradles of the Quechua language.
On a local level, the public university San Simón (UMSS) has played an important role in developing resources to promote the language online, such as the multimedia Quechua podcast platform created by the Applied Linguistics for Language Teaching team at UMSS.
In addition, two of the workshop organizers, Gladys Camacho and Juan Carlos Romero, have been very active with the Linguistics Department of the university and have also participated as Quechua teachers.
Both shared their experiences promoting the language through a variety of multimedia platforms.
Camacho continued her graduate studies at New York University where she contributed to the Rimasun audio podcast project.
As part of his teaching duties, Romero filmed videos depicting daily situations using the Quechua language, including the following that took place at the dentist's office.
Based in the Department of Santa Cruz, the Voces Indígenas Urbanas project shared their work listening and amplifying the voices of indigenous communities living in the country's largest city of Santa Cruz. Among the topics that they regularly discuss include the importance of maintaining the language.
Network The Bolivian workshop continues to demonstrate the interest and need for gatherings such as this to connect indigenous internet users who have made a commitment to preserve and advance their languages with the aid of digital technologies.
Their own experiences often mirror those of others regardless of language, and real and virtual spaces can help share these lessons learned and become the building blocks for the creation of local networks of digital activists who share a common mission.
Mexico: "How to download Pokemon Go"
Costa Rica: "What happens if volcano Turrialba erupts?"
Panama: "How to make wooden beds?"
Colombia: "What is the Fellowship of the Ring?"
Peru: "How to make dog clothes?"
Chile: "How to make a concept map?"
Argentina: "How to lose the tummy?"
Uruguay: "How to decrease my internet use?"
Brazil: "What is love?"
On Facebook users commented on the results.
From Acapulco, Mexico, Diana Soto shared her despair regarding Mexico's result:
Diana Soto: "How to make a concept map?" made me laugh.
But then I saw Mexico with Pokemon Go and I lost the smile.
Gris Simonds-Gómez also felt Mexico's worries were trivial and posted ironically:
Gris Simonds-Gómez: Fuck the narco, insecurity, corruption, overweight and misery, I want to know how to download pokemon go!
While Adolfo Meza sarcastically commented on Peruvians' searches:
Adolfo Meza: well, at least we'll have the most fashionable dogs in America...
Meanwhile Felipe Maluenda, from Antofagasta, Chile jokingly admitted his contribution to his country's top search results:
Felipe Eduardo Mauelanda Bravo: I am the one responsible of "How to make a conceptual map?", I looked for it all year long so I could do my homework and still haven't figured it out.
From Cordoba, Argentina, Alejandro Pablo Drallny reflected on the interest Argentineans have in their looks:
Alejandro Pablo Drallny: Argentina, a superficial country, everyone worried about how to lose the tummy (and since I am Argentinean, if someone knows how to do it, let me know)
Diego Bautista commented on Costa Rica's search preferences:
Diego Bautista: "How to make a wooden bed?"
Just one country looking for something useful to do.
René Vaca Cardozo, from Bogotá, Colombia, explained why Colombians were so worried about the Fellowship of the Ring:
René Vaca Cardozo: Don't think that Colombians are worried about Tolkien's literature.
The Fellowship of the Ring is the name that the media gave to a sexual and homicide scandal in the police force.
Ruben Pintos Guerra, from Montevideo, Uruguay pointed out:
Ruben Pintos Guerra: We have the best Internet of the region and we asked how to reduce our consumption...
COME ON URUGUAY!
From Costa Rica, Mar Barquero reflected:
Marc Barquero Suárez: Brazilians are more profound... meanwhile we'll die burnt with lava
Andrea Marysenka also had a message for Brazilians:
Others talked about changes in priorities: Alvaro Alatorre: If we are no longer looking for: "How to know if my girlfriend is pregnant" we are losing the value and true use of Saint Google. How sad.
Ilhaser Lara: Nobody is looking for "Evidence of real goblins" or "Videos of real ghosts" and not even "Videos of aliens"...
Charles: "The world isn't what it used to be!!"
Ariel Aguilar: How philosophical, how profound the doubts that trouble the Latin American minds of our times are.
On the morning of April 7, Venezuelan netizens reported that they were unable to access the web TV channel Vivoplay from inside the country.
Others have since reported that VPITV and El Capitolio TV have also been inaccessible.
These and other web TV channels had been broadcasting protests in Caracas, which were organized by those opposing Nicolás Maduro's administration.
The demonstrations unfolded last week after the country's Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and reassigned its functions to the executive branch and the Supreme Court itself.
He was released eight hours later and VPITV ’ s streaming resumed. While some of these site's broadcasts are still available via YouTube, there are also reports that the government is throttling Internet connections, making it difficult for Venezuelans to obtain multimedia coverage as events unfold in the country.

It's April Fool's Day — "Day of Laughter" in the Russian-speaking world — and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has seized the opportunity to indulge in some geopolitical satire, delighting in the attention Russia has drawn for interfering in the 2016 American presidential election.
The MFA posted a video of a joke Russian Embassy voicemail recording on its Facebook page this morning with the caption, "The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has worked out a full voicemail recording for all Russian diplomatic missions abroad."
"Good day!
You have reached the Russian Embassy.
Your call is very important to us.
To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponent, press 1. To use the services of Russian hackers, press 2.
To request election interference, press 3 and wait until the next election campaign.
Please note that all calls are monitored for quality control and training purposes. "
Take a listen here (the English version of the voicemail begins at 0: 29):
Polish adventurers entered the town of Pripyat in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and turned on lights for the first time since the 1986 nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
Photo from Napromieniowani's Facebook page. On April 26, 1986, a nuclear meltdown at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine caused radioactive material to be spewed into the atmosphere, exposing hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of people in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe to extremely high doses of radiation.
The effects of the nuclear fallout are still being felt: more than 500,000 people in Belarus, the country most affected by the disaster, have thyroid problems stemming from Chernobyl radiation, and more than 2 million people live in areas of the country that put them at high risk of contamination.
Last week, on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the disaster, a group of Polish adventurers decided to turn the lights back on in Pripyat, a radioactive ghost town located three miles from the Chernobyl reactor.
Pripyat was evacuated the day after the meltdown and has been abandoned ever since — though it has become the center of the disaster tourism industry that has developed in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
The lights come on at a school in Pripyat.
Using generators, the Poles were able to electrify some of Pripyat's buildings, lighting up the abandoned city for the first time in more than 3 decades.
The adventurers posted the photos on the Facebook page they curate, Napromieniowani.pl. This post has been updated to provide proper attribution for the photographs. They were originally posted on Napromieniowani.pl, and are republished here with permission.
When you first encounter people who come from countries or who speak languages that aren't your own, you might think that your differences are greater than your similarities.
But spend a little time together, and you'll start to see that you have more in common than you first thought.
These global connections are important because they challenge our beliefs, they broaden our perspective, and they remind us that it might just be a small world after all.
In this edition of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast where we take a closer look at one topic that isn ’ t getting the media coverage it deserves, we are digging deep into global connections.
We speak with five Global Voices contributors who recall a moment in which they felt connected to someone across borders and across language. Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a hiking trip cemented her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa remembers how a love of music overcame a lack of a shared language while traveling in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about her time working with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experience living in a small village in Madagascar.

Tulip at Chios Island, Northern Aegean.
Photo by author
When you hear the word tulip, you might think of the Netherlands, maybe even the 17th-century tulip mania.
But did you know that the golden era of the Ottoman Empire is called the "Tulip Period" (Lale Devri)?
That's just one small testament of how the flowers are found elsewhere in the world.
On the small Greek island of Chios in the Northern Aegean sea, tulips are called “lalades, ” and at the beginning of March they flood the fields and olive groves with blossoms that only last for 7-10 days.
Famous for its equally renowned mastic trees and, more recently, known for accepting a big influx of migrants and refugees from the Middle East via Turkey, Chios has long marked spring by the blooming of tulips.
The flowers are a traditional cultivation that provides a livelihood to villagers.
Tulips originated in Central Asia and spread through the Mediterranean territories to central and eastern Europe.
The local Chios term for tulip, lalades, speaks to the flower's history: lale is the Persian name for tulip, which through Turkish eventually entered the Chian dialect.
Fourteen tulip species are cultivated in Greece, four of them especially in the central and southeastern parts of Chios Island (Tulipa praecox, Tulipa agenensis, Tulipa clusiana, Tulipa undulatifolia).
Lalades at Kallimassia village, Chios Island.
You can see also olive trees and mastic trees in the background.

Tulipa praecox is locally called Turkish lale.
It has a vivid red color and can reach up to 70 centimeters in height, and is usually found around cultivated fields and olive groves.
Tulipa agenensis, locally called Frankish lale, can reach up to 50 centimeters and has red flowers with black dots and yellow stripes inside.
Tulipa undulatifolia is also a rare and endangered species, up to 30 centimeters in height, with orange red blossoms and wavy leaves. It can be found in cultivated areas as well, usually near pistacia fields.
Finally, Tulipa clusiana, locally known as Constantinople or Babylonian lale, grows up to 60 centimeters and has white blossoms marked with intense exterior scarlet stripes. This species is rare and originates from Persia.
Lalades are a precious natural treasure for Chios Island, but the flowers do face some pressures.
If care is not taken, the traditional massive collection and the digging up of their bulbs every year could wear out the soil.
Furthermore, the abandonment of traditional cultivation practices and the adoption of modern methods of plowing can destroy bulbs.
The presence of Venezuela's ombudsman, Tarek William Saab, in Beirut was not met kindly by Venezuelans in Lebanon, who organized protests to denounce violence in ongoing demonstrations in the Latin American country.
The ombudsman, whose official title is Public Defender of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Defensoría del Pueblo de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela), was supposedly giving a speech on human rights in Beirut.
Critics denounced his trip to Lebanon in the middle of the political crisis that has seen weeks of protests, in which 30 people have been reported killed as of May 4, 2017.
The most recent protests in a country that has seen political turmoil for years started when the Supreme Court of Justice effectively nullified the National Assembly on March 30.
Despite the decision being short-lived, the widely unpopular government of Maduro, which has overseen a three-year-long economic crisis and record levels of violent crime and poverty, has inspired a growing opposition to his policies.
Two Lebanese-Venezuelan women interrupted Saab's speech while holding the Venezuelan flag upside down (one of the main symbols within the current protests) and yelling "My people are dying!
We're being killed!
Where are rights, Tarek? "
Martyrs' Square in Beirut, a highly symbolic location where, for example, Lebanon's YouStink movement gathered to protest in the summer of 2015, saw a concentration of people banging on pots (a common way of protesting in Latin America).
The following video shows protesters outside the hotel where Saab was residing, near Martyrs' Square.
VIDEO. Venezuelans keep protesting against Tarek William Saab outside the hotel where he's staying in Beirut, Lebanon.
The video of the two women quickly went viral and made # Líbano (# Lebanon) a trending topic in Venezuela.
Some users took the opportunity to spotlight the crackdown taking place in Venezuela at the same time that he was in Beirut:
Look, Tarek William Saab, while you're eating hummus in Lebanon Those who don't practice Human Rights # Venezuela, can't talk about them or represent the nation in # Lebanon
How does it feel not even being able to go to Lebanon without being dogged by the reality that you're so badly trying to block on Twitter? What nerve.
Tarek WIlliam Saab, who should ensure the Human Rights of Venezuelans and doesn't do it, goes and talks about Human Rights in # Lebanon.
I don't know what amazes me more, that scoundrel talking about human rights in a country like Lebanon or the incredible courage of those women # Dictatorship There are an estimated 400,000 to 800,000 Venezuelans of Lebanese descent, the largest population of Lebanese in Latin America outside of Brazil and Argentina.
Writer and journalist César Miguel Rondón was prevented from leaving Venezuela, after authorities confiscated his and his family's passports at Maiquetía's International Airport Simón Bolívar and declared them invalid.
Venezuelan authorities said the passports had been reported as' stolen 'to the government department Administrative Service of Identification, Migration and Foreigners.
According to the news site Runrun.es this is not the first time Venezuela's government has used this strategy "as a way to prohibit leaving the country".
Days before Rondón was prevented from leaving the country, President Nicolás Maduro threatened Rondón with prison on Twitter for his comments on escrache, a protest tactic recently adopted by Venezuelans in which demonstrators confront and publicly shame government officials and their children living outside Venezuela.
The confrontations are often marked with loud banging pots, which is another protest tactic called cacerolazo.
The tweet from Rondón that generated a threat from President Maduro said: "How does it feel to be spat on worldwide?
To have no place to hide, plane to fly in, to never be in peace? "
The following video shows Maripili Hernández, a former Venezuelan minister, being escorted by police to safety after she was confronted by protestors at a restaurant in Madrid:
Under Maduro, Venezuela has been struggling with a massive economic crisis, food and medicine shortages, record levels of violent crime and poverty, and relentless power cuts for three years.
Maduro's government has suppressed protests, censored the press and curtailed free expression during this time.
Opponents, critics and journalists whose reporting puts the government in a negative light face imprisonment.
Some have gone into self-imposed exile.
Others have simply gone silent.
Rondón's Twitter feed was changed to 'protected mode', but the tweets that generated the president's comments were reproduced as screenshots alongside screenshots of his apology tweets, and reframed by government supporters who accused Rondón of being a "fascist" and a hypocrite:
And that's punishable by Venezuelan law. Rondón responded on Twitter, saying he didn't mean to promote any words of hate and underlined how throughout his career, his words were never used to promote hate.
Online media outlets reported on his response, in which Rondón apologized if his words had been misinterpreted, and maintained that he condemned the public shaming protests.
As quoted by Runrun.es:
The journalist responded on Twitter: I have a public, 4 decade-old career.
I've never uttered one word encouraging hate or violence among Venezuelans. As a democrat, I've respected everyone else's position, even if I don't share them.
With words, never with violence.
Today, while editing this story, the passport of an opposition leader and former presidential hopeful Henrique Capriles Radonski was also suddenly declared "invalid" as he was on his way to speak at the UN about human rights abuses in Venezuela.
I was retained and they invalidated my passport in the airport, which was valid until 2020
Image from @ CNI _ Mexico, the Twitter account of the National Indigenous Congress In a historic decision for Mexico, the country's indigenous peoples appointed María de Jesús Patricio Martínez as spokeswoman for the National Indigenous Governing Council, with the intent for her to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential elections of 2018.
The colleague María de Jesús Patricio Martinez is the spokeswoman of the Indigenous Governing Council The idea of setting up the Council, whose voice would be "materialized by an indigenous woman," arose in October 2016, after the Fifth National Indigenous Congress.
We reaffirm that our struggle is not for power, we do not seek it; rather we will call on the indigenous peoples and civil society to organize ourselves to stop this destruction, to strengthen our resistances and rebellions, that is, the defense of the life of every person, every family, group, community or neighborhood.
To build peace and justice by reweaving ourselves from below, from where we are what we are. According to the CNI, 523 communities from 25 states and 43 indigenous peoples approved the proposal in December 2016, so that the constitution of the Council and the appointment of their respective spokesperson would take place in May 2017.
In its press release at that time, the CNI stated the following regarding the Indigenous Governing Council (CIG, its initials in Spanish):
The CIG is the core of the CNI's proposal to the country and to the indigenous peoples.
It is the way in which we will organize ourselves nationwide from below and to the left to govern this country based on the other politics, that of the peoples, of the assembly, of the participation of all and everyone.
It is the way in which we the people organize ourselves to make decisions on the issues and problems that involve all of us.
Precisely with the aim of distancing themselves from the narrative of political parties, and in order to abide by their collective forms of organization and representation, both the CNI and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation have insisted that it is not a question of promoting a candidate but a spokesperson:
She will be the one to carry the voice of the Indigenous Governing Council to the whole country, to the whole world. She will be the voice of the peoples and civil society. She will be us.
At least 848 delegates and councillors from about 60 indigenous peoples of the country, as well as the General Command of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, participated in the nomination Assembly.
Let this country shake with the resistance, rebellion and dignity of all the peoples of Mexico.
María de Jesús Patricio Martínez (also known as Marichuy) is a traditional medicine doctor and Nahua from Tuxpan in the state of Jalisco.
In 2010, she stated her desire for an organization like the recently created National Indigenous Governing Council: I long for an organization managed from the bottom up, in which all agreements are obeyed and respected.
In the following Spanish-language AJ + video made prior to her appointment as spokesperson, Marichuy herself emphasizes the importance of choosing an indigenous woman to raise awareness of the problems, struggles and traditions of indigenous communities during the elections.
The 2018 presidential elections will be the first to allow the nomination of independent candidates.
But, in order to do so, the candidates must fulfill a series of requirements established in the Seventh Book of the General Law on Electoral Institutions and Procedures.
They include: establishing a civil association opening a bank account registering with the Tax Administration Service and once registered as candidates, gathering the support of 1 per cent of the total number of citizens registered in the national electoral register (about 1 million signatures) distributed in at least 17 states.
It remains to be seen whether María de Jesús Patricio Martínez's candidacy will succeed in meeting the deadlines and requirements of the Mexican electoral system.
In her own words, as captured in this video:
Our participation is for life, it is for the reconstruction of our peoples who have been beaten for years and years.
Screenshot of the Femicides in Mexico Map.
So far, it has recorded 2,355 cases.
The map's creator uses the practical definition of the United Nations model protocol for the investigation of gender-related killings of women, which defines "femicide" as:
the murder of women because they are women, whether it is committed within the family, a domestic partnership, or any other interpersonal relationship, or by anyone in the community, or whether it is perpetrated or tolerated by the state or its agents.4
Her sources are newspaper reports and official statements on femicides, and her motivation is simple and clear: to name every single one of the women so that they are not forgotten.
She uses the pseudonym "Princesa" ("Princess") to conceal her true identity so as to ensure her safety. Princesa says she became aware of community affairs through her mother, now 80 years old.
Her mother, originally from the state of Zacatecas but who moved to Mexico City, is a working woman, the granddaughter of revolutionaries, with strong religious beliefs and who fights for the rights of the just and those of workers.
Princesa studied physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and developed a passion for seismology and tsunamis.
She ended up working commerce, but also became involved with maps when she collaborated with the intersectional peace project Nuestra Aparente Rendición ("Our Apparent Surrender") and with online grassroots groups that track cases of kidnappings.
Her dedication and technical knowledge gradually grew, as well as her ability to deal with big data and to use tools for the systematisation of geographical coordinates.
On the Femicides in Mexico Map's Facebook page, she receives messages from the press, politicians, legislators and ordinary people interested in her documentation project, but for her, the most important messages are those from the family members of the victims.
Seeing the names of their daughters and the places in which they lost their lives on the map is a way of recognising that they have a name, a history, and that their lives have value, Princesa says, as she recalls some of those messages.
And she adds:
This map makes it possible to highlight the places where we're being killed, identify patterns, back up arguments concerning the problem, georeference sources of help, encourage prevention and try to prevent femicides.
Princesa's project is undertaken pro bono, so she is in constant need of support.
For this reason, she has opened a fundraising page on the Generosity website, where she explains a bit more about her motivation:
gather essential information so that journalists, researchers, activists, human rights campaigners, those who seek justice and those who take decisions understand the reality of femicide in Mexico.
It is a harsh, day-to-day reality which is constantly increasing.
A picture says more than a thousand words and there are still a thousand stories to be told.
Support the Femicide Map # MapadeFeminicidios https: / / t.co / jd4XqyVpcu # Niunamenos
Princesa says she's happy doing something for people.
Her mother and sister think likewise; her father always asks her to be careful, but also to not give up doing it because it is so worthwhile.

The Wikipedia article on “Gender bias on Wikipedia ” states matter-of-factly that numerous studies and surveys have found that“ a dominant majority of Wikipedia editors are male, ” citing the figures of anywhere between 85-91.5%.
It ’ s a cause for concern for both the community at-large and the Wikimedia Foundation, the entity that manages the world ’ s largest free online encyclopedia, because this demographic disparity may contribute to a systematic bias found in its content.
The Wikimujeres (Wikiwomen) project has been working in Spanish and Catalan-speaking countries to help change those demographics.
According to their website:
We are group of Wikipedia users concerned about the diversity and neutrality of Wikipedia and we are willing to work to reduce (and in the future eliminate) the gender and culture gap that exists on the most widely consulted encyclopedia on the internet.
Their goal is to involve more women as active editors who can also contribute more content related to women, such as biographies, as well as content created by women editors in the developing world.
Holding weekly meetings in two locations in Madrid and Barcelona, outreach plays an important role in the form of trainings and “edit-a-thons, ” which are organized, often in-person events designed to work collaboratively on creating new or improving Wikipedia articles.

Recent edit-a-thons focused on adding new articles about women photographers and women scientists were co-organized by Wikimujeres and were held at the Medialab-Prado in Madrid.

In response, the government declared martial law in Mindanao to pursue the attackers and prevent the spread of ISIS in other towns.
The clash between the military and the militant group known as Maute forced the mass evacuation of Marawi residents.
As of June 7, more than 46,000 families, or 220,000 persons, have been displaced from their homes.
The government said it has provided 33 evacuation centers, but these could only shelter 18,000 persons.
After three weeks of being a battle zone, hundreds of houses and other buildings in Marawi were destroyed.
The extent of the damage was revealed when rescuers, residents, and journalists uploaded photos and videos of Marawi ’ s town proper.
The Maute group is blamed for the destruction, but the military is also being held accountable because of its continuous airstrikes.
The military claimed it is conducting ‘ surgical bombing ’ operations, but some residents said the air bombs are being dropped indiscriminately.
Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra is saddened by the destruction in his city:
I weep for all the civilians who were mercilessly killed, I weep for the lost homes of my people and I weep for the loss of the true essence of Islam in the people who caused all these destructions to our lives and properties.
As of May 30, the government said 19 civilians were killed by terrorists.
It is ordinary civilians who are enduring the greatest suffering as the crisis continues to drag on.
And even if the clashes end soon, rehabilitating Marawi is expected to be a more difficult task because of the destruction caused by the fighting between the military and the militants.
Below are photos and videos showing the situation in Marawi today:

We're excited to announce that the 2017 edition of the Global Voices Summit will take place on December 2-3 in Colombo, Sri Lanka!
Our seventh Summit takes us for the second time to South Asia, where we'll convene two days of public conversations and workshops with bloggers, activists, technologists, journalists, policymakers, development experts and others from around the world and address the evolving state of citizen media, open Internet advocacy, open Internet culture, and grassroots activism from a Global South perspective.
Like all GV events, the 2017 Summit, will be a great opportunity for learning and sharing with a diverse and dynamic global community.
Supported by Groundviews, with sponsorship from the Mozilla Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation and others, our 2017 meeting will analyze the challenges to the open internet, looking at questions of open architecture and conditions for safe and free expression in an environment of increasing threats to both.
We will explore how key ideas in the architecture of the internet and of discourse can rewire our societies for resilience, reflection and deep research.
Stay tuned for the launch of the Summit website and details on venues, registration, programming and more — and do save the date!

Donald Trump:
Do you happen to know the meaning of dignity?
The measures that you announced today, President Trump, are pathetic.
As pathetic as that group of people who call themselves Cubans, and who gathered around the leader of another country to beg him to economically strangle their own. Those who yell "Long Live Free Cuba" from the other side of the Straits of Florida, or the congressman who can barely pronounce the word "freedom" with the beauty and looseness of the Spanish language.
The measures you announced today are disrespectful of the Cuban government and disrespectful of the Cuban people.
They are disrespectful of me.
An absolute arrogance — a word that not by chance rhymes with "ignorance" — has characterized all your presidency, and reached a turning point today, June 16, 2017.
It is not possible to ask to a president who is incapable of understanding the fundamentals of climate change — which is especially noticeable in the state where his most cherished property is located — to understand the complexities of a country like Cuba.
A president who has been unable to commit to the future of humanity, who is incapable of committing to the future of a small Caribbean island and its citizens.
And it would have been extremely simple. All the Cuban citizens have asked of the United States since forever is respect.
And the only thing we didn't get this June 16 was precisely that — respect.
At the beginning of my letter, Mr. President, I asked if you knew the meaning of the word dignity.
It is easy for a ruler to have dignity.
He or she doesn't have to choose what to eat, where to sleep, what his or her kids wear.
It is people, not governments, who can fancy themselves dignified, because they are the ones who face tough decisions.
I come from a poor, dignified family.
People who were born poor and dignified, and who have remained poor and dignified for almost three generations. Primary school teachers, librarians, school aides, technicians, cowboys, farmers.
When my mother asked what I wanted to study if I managed to go to university, I, a 9-year old girl, answered "Anything but a teacher because I don't want us to be so poor".
The windows of my mother's bedroom were paid for with the profits from selling two orphaned sheep we had fed with baby bottles.
I have had the same bed for 25 years.
I remember each pair of my shoes since sixth grade, because I have only had three.
I could tell you about the first time I saw a foreigner throwing candies out of his rental car on Guanabo Beach, because never before had I seen candies of such colors.
I remember every book I read from seventh to ninth grade because they saved me from the so-called Special Period.
Even with all these economic hardships, somehow I managed to be happy.
Mangoes, tomato season, and the mountains that surrounded my house made me happy.
One day, I told my friends from school that if you follow the track across the mountain behind my house, you could arrive at Guantanamo Bay.
There were so many repeated stories and mysteries around that place that wasn't yet a torture camp, but a space for Cuban fishermen, that brought it close to me.
I told them about the minefields, the sea, the Cuban soldiers' faces, the American faces, the camping tents.
Poverty taught me to imagine.
I don't think all kids should have to be poor in order to develop their imaginations. All I am saying is that, somehow, maybe in a manner that's somewhat twisted, we have learned to overcome reality barriers.
You can hear stories like these in any Cuban street.
On December 17, 2014, Barack Obama showed that another reality was possible.
But to be fair, we have learned to be mistrustful.
We have learned to wait and hope for the worse and celebrate the good, when it comes.
It almost never comes.
Not the wage increases, the Internet access we need, the Constitutional reforms we ask for; not the prosperous economy or the sustainable socialism — nothing.
Instead we had immigration reform, the end of the carte blanche, the opening up of the private sector, the ability to buy and sell cars and houses and another bunch of favors euphemistically disguised as "reforms".
In this back and forth between people and government we have accomplished things, and other things, age-old debts of a country to its people, start to crumble.
Repeat after me, Mr. President: “Access to education should be free and universal". This is not a Bernie Sanders issue, is an objective that several countries infinitely poorer than yours have managed to achieve.
Repeat after me, President: "Access to health care should be free and universal".
Another nice way for not only Cuba, but also Switzerland, Singapore, Ireland, Canada, to ridicule your country.
A huge international conspiracy to put the United States in an awkward position.
Individual trips by American citizens are done.
Do you know whom this decision harms?
Firstly: the people of your country; a country that boasts of its freedom and that allows its government to limit its freedom of movement (enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
Secondly: the government of your country.
What kind of global power believes that allowing its people to travel to an island with 11 million inhabitants and a president named Castro could enrich only that government?
Have you ever seen someone from the Cuban government cleaning Saratoga Hotel rooms, serving in the taverns and restaurants proliferating across Havana, planting the organic food Americans want so badly?
Have you seen Raúl Castro selling souvenirs in Cathedral Plaza?
Have you seen José Ramón Machado Ventura taking a bus to get to work early? Have you seen Ramiro Valdés' house listed on Airbnb?
Or Miguel Díaz Canel offering round-trip airport taxi service to a Kentucky citizen?
Is Lázara Mercedes López Acea cleaning bathrooms in Terminal 3?
I'll help you with the answer: No.
It is not only the aforementioned persons who benefit from the increase in American tourism to our island.
The government takes its cut, obviously — you should know that since you are a now in government — but also the common citizen: the waitress, the farmer, the taxi driver, the cleaning lady....
You didn't even have George W. Bush's courage to halt money transfers, travels and visas.
They're a smoke screen. A distraction to keep the American people focused on something besides what really matters to the country.
Meaning not even the future, but the current state of the country.
Your measures, President, are the result of political arrogance and disrespect.
Other countries may yield to your country.
Cuba has never done so and won't start now.

When disaster strikes, being able to count on accurate information can mean a world of difference for first response teams.
Knowing where people live, the best ways to get in and out, as well as locations of water and other basic necessities are all of great importance to those working to save lives.
Unfortunately, vulnerable people especially those living in rural communities are more likely to live in areas not properly mapped.
The Missing Maps project, an open, collaborative project, is working to fill in this “missing ” information.
Combining the work of volunteers contributing remotely, on-the-ground community leaders, and humanitarian organizations, the project works hand-in-hand with the OpenStreetMaps platform to collect data in a free and open manner.
Volunteers around the world participate by reviewing satellite imagery to identify and map buildings, roads, and other essential landmarks.
They can do so in their own free time or as part of an organized “map-a-thon ”.
This initial information can then be verified by groups on the ground in close contact with community leaders.
One of the largest Missing Maps projects took place in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea to map more than 7,000 communities that were severely affected by the recent Ebola epidemic.
Following this mapping work, humanitarian organizations now have access to accurate names and locations for these villages, which can play a major role in any future crisis response.

Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos that he saw around him – blurry, with subjects poorly positioned and washed-out colors.
So, he was motivated to carry a camera of his own and try to fix the situation.
That was when he was a child.
Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is striving to put Nepal ’ s wildlife on the international stage.
And his hometown, which sits next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that call attention to Nepal's animal world.
He explained on Facebook how this prime location helps him with his work:
I live on edge of the World Heritage Site Chitwan National Park, what can be better for a wildlife Photographer enthusiast!!
So, today i was resting at my place and suddenly Navaraj (Manager at Chitwan Gaida Lodge) calls me, he got my dad's call that there is the leopard at the bank of Rapti river.
The River dam just a few minutes away at the touristic place of Sauraha.
I immediately ran with my camera & reached within minutes.
My Dad had been watching him, showed me the place across the River a long Distance where Leopard was and immediately my shutter burst began!!
Sagar aspires to work with the government to get Nepal's nature recognized worldwide and wants to create awareness that wild animals are not fearsome as they look.
Late evening too low on the light.
Home time for all the animals & birds.
I was also returning home coz of darkness, then suddenly appears the King from the Bushes, immediately sits when we both see each other & Stares at me through the sal trees!!
Seeing the need to protect wild animals, Sagar puts the logo “i click for conservation ” in his pictures.
His passion for promoting the nature and wildlife of Nepal, however, isn ’ t always easy.
He has waited for 22 days to shoot photos of otters in Bardia National Park living mostly in a tent, and up to 12 days to capture images of tigers, and six to seven days to get a perfect shot of birds living in nearby lodges.
Take a look at some of his photos below.

We are deeply saddened to learn about the death of our friend Bassel Khartabil.
We mourn his loss and send our deepest condolences to his family, friends and all those who knew and loved him.
A Creative Commons leader in Syria who was active in projects including Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel Khartabil (aka Bassel Safadi) played a pivotal role in extending online access and open knowledge to the public in Syria.
He was a close friend of many in the Global Voices community and participated in our 2009 Arab Bloggers Meeting.
In November 2015, Bassel's wife reported that she was contacted by people who identified themselves as Assad government insiders.
They told Noura Ghazi that her husband had been sentenced to death, but offered no further information.
Bassel's whereabouts and condition were unknown until today, when Noura learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015.
Today and beyond, we honor all of Bassel's work as a leader in the open web movement. And we honor the efforts of many individuals and organizations that advocated for his release over the past five years.
Since the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.
Untold numbers of those who have been arrested or forcibly disappeared by the regime have faced torture and even executions.
As of 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians had died in custody since 2011, according to the international human rights group Amnesty International.
The stories of many more people remain unknown.

A pop song written and performed by Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov and two of his grandchildren is attracting attention after independent media outlet Chronicles of Turkmenistan posted video of it on their Facebook page.
It's not quite at the level of worldwide smash “Despacito ”, but still some fans appeared to enjoy the music:
A very good voice. Cultural leisure is necessary for everyone.
The soul is enriched by this song!
Turkmenistan has an abysmal human rights record and is experiencing a difficult economic situation, with unemployment and shortages of basic goods on the rise.
But Berdimuhamedov, who in February 2017 "won the hearts" of 97.69% of voters in the country's presidential election, prefers not to publicly say a word, instead propagandizing the “great achievements of the country and a successful life of his people. ”
Many of those achievements are his own: “Yadimda ” (Turkmen for" I Remember ") is not the first number written and sung by the Turkmen president, and writing songs and singing are not his only talents.
Berdimukhamedov, deemed “one of worst world dictators ” by the Foreign Policy magazine, is the author of more than 40 books on different topics.
A work of his on tea last year, for example, was received by his compatriots with almost religious reverence:
A dentist by education and a lifelong sportsman, he once forced his ministers to join him at the fitness club: And at the end of July, in anticipation of the country's hosting of the 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games in September, the president took part in a bike ride that shut down private motor vehicle transportation in the capital.
The 60-year-old Berdimuhamedov climbed to power at the very end of 2006 after his predecessor Saparmurat Niyazov, who had been in power since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, died.
Niyazov, who named himself Turkmenbashi (Father of Turkmens), fostered a personality cult around his rule.
Among other things, he changed the alphabet in the country to the Latin, changed the names of the months (April was named after his mother), changed the names of the week (Saturday was changed after his spiritual book “Rukhnama ”), and implemented many other eccentric ideas.
His “Rukhnama ” became the second sacred book for Turkmens after the Quran and everyone had to learn it by heart, while around 15,000 monuments of him, including several golden ones, were built around the country.

Public domain.
After Niyazov ’ s death, Berdimuhammedov, whose official titles (that he awarded to himself) include “Leader of the Nation ” and“ Arkadag "meaning" protector ", destroyed the personality cult of his predecessor and built up his own.
His regime kept up the restrictions on freedoms.
Turkmenistan is home to the world's fourth biggest gas reserves, and is suffering from a serious economic crisis - yet will soon host the Asian Games.
This is what happens when someone has a lot of money and uses the country ’ s wealth and resources for own private purposes.
I won ’ t be surprised if tomorrow he wants his own spacecraft or ballistic rocket.
The country is in big trouble, people are hungry and cold, and there is no economy, no production, living only because of gas sales and the great will of Saint Gurbanguly the Great.
At a time when almost all the news about Puerto Rico in mainstream media is firmly focussed on the island's fiscal and economic woes, the deluge of negative headlines making the rounds on social media can feel overwhelming.
The Juice Media, a Facebook page which specializes in satire, created a video about what it believes to be the root cause of many of Puerto Rico's troubles and disadvantages: US colonialism.
Widely shared on Facebook, its creators were encouraged to produce the clip after the success of a similar video about Hawai'i in their "Honest Government Advert" series.
The video summarizes some of the ways the US government has historically exploited Puerto Rico, from using it as a bombing practice site for decades, to sterilizing over a third of Puerto Rican women without their knowledge or consent in the mid-twentieth century.
The cheery presenter in the clip begins:
Fortunately, however, few know about the real Puerto Rico, a Territory of the United States since 1898 when we seized it from the Spanish who in turn stole it from the Taino Which makes Puerto Ricans US citizens — well second-class citizens … despite fighting in every one of our wars they still can ’ t vote for President and have no representation in Congress.
In other words, US citizens who have f * -all say in the laws the US Government makes for them...
The video can be watched in full below:
Screen capture from video livecast of a swimming event in Guangzhou. Via Weibo.
During a live-streamed video of a swimming event in the Zhujiang, known in English as the Pearl River, a reporter from the Southern Metropolis Daily drank a few mouthfuls of river water to prove that it was clean.
The screen capture of the livecast has gone viral on social media.
In a number of media workers ’ WeChat groups, journalists have called it an unprofessional and propaganda that has shamed the whole news media industry.
The swim was held on July 25 near Sun Yatsen University Pier in China's Guangzhou city at the lower course of Zhujiang.
The annual event was under the theme “Everyone, Work Out and Stay Healthy ” (全民健身.全民健康) and about 2,000 people participated.
A number of Chinese state-affiliated media outlets featured the event and Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolis Daily broadcast it live.
While doing so, the reporter said in front of the camera that the river water looked clean and transparent and drank a few mouthfuls to prove his point.
According to discussions on social media (as reported by Hong Kong online media outlet HK01), the journalist actually drank from the water three times: in his first attempt, the camera happened to move away; the second was broadcast to the public, and the third was to pose for photos.
Zhujiang is the third longest river in China and its mouth is located at the most industrialized and polluted Pearl River Delta.
Even though efforts were made between 2007 and 2013 to clean up the river, the water quality in the lower course of the river is still poor and far from being suitable for drinking.
The reporter's action has hence stirred a lot of frustration among media workers' social circles on WeChat.
In one of the groups, a reporter pointed out that Southern Metropolis Daily was one of the most critical media outlets in China just a few years back, but now it had devolved into a “positive energy ” propaganda machine.
The criticisms from fellow media workers are also being shared by netizens.
On one of the news threads on Weibo, many said the water-drinking stunt was unprofessional:
Such act should not be encouraged!
Journalists are not politicians, credibility is the most important thing for a media outlet.
This reporter can definitely advance in his career.
Come, there is a position in the Environmental Bureau. Come take the position.
Those who claimed that Zhujiang water was sweet advanced in their careers, this guy wanted to follow their example.
What can he prove by eating faeces?
He can prove that faeces is edible
Quite sure that he has never seen the dead rats and dead pigs floating like balloons in the river.

Think You've Mastered Tongue Twisters?
Lezgi is a Caucasian language claiming around 800,000 speakers worldwide.
It is well established in its native region across the border between Azerbaijan and the Russian Republic of Dagestan, where it enjoys official status.
Nevertheless, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified it as a "vulnerable" language, one rarely spoken by children outside of their home, thus jeopardizing its transmission to future generations. Losing a language is losing a whole culture, a way of thinking.
It happens with most languages which are in danger, not only with us. I do this because I want our people to be more aware about their language, culture and history.
The video below is a list of six tongue twisters in Lezgi, but perhaps they should be called "throat twisters" instead, since Piotr Kozłowski, a Lezgi-language learner and the founder of a website dedicated to Lezgi, confided that trying to pronounce them feels like it may "do terrible damage to your throat":
It is also the name of a recollection tool for the project QuechuaASR that aims to create an automatic speech recognition system, or ASR, for the Quechua language.
The actual number of speakers is difficult to calculate, and the wide domination of Spanish in the region, specially in formal education make it difficult for Quechua speakers to develop their language.
The different ways in which the indigenous populations suffer from discrimination are among the most important causes of vulnerability. Some parents avoid teaching Quechua to their children to ensure they can integrate into society, and others who speak it can lose it when they migrate to big urban areas.
As recounted by Lorenzo Colque Arias, president of the Academy of Quechua Language in Arequipa: The inhabitants of Arequipa become very aggressive when they hear someone speaking Quechua.
They're migrants residing in the city, and they're now the ones who discriminate.
I am following my biggest dream: the computational portability of all the Andean Amazonian languages. In a 2015 post on the same social network, Luis Camacho asked Quechua speakers to participate in recording at least a hundred thousand words, all spoken by at least one hundred people.
Moreover, the hundred people in question had to be native Quechua speakers, rather than people who had learned Quechua as a second language.
To achieve this, there was an open call for volunteers who are native speakers of Quechua, regardless of where they live. The first course of action is for volunteers to read the texts compiled. Secondly, the volunteers are responsible for transcribing the audio.
Finally, the focus groups convene with a group of people to talk about different topics of everyday life, and with that they record the audio which will later be transcribed.
The content of the recordings is not the main subject of the research.
The central point will be compiling the lexicon as a sort of dictionary of voices.
The research seeks to record the existing lexicon of indigenous languages and build a database that can be implemented in the development of computer tools.
Global Voices spoke briefly with Luis Camacho about his project ’ s progress.
GV: What's the status of the project so far?
Luis Camacho (LC): We have already compiled 100 hours of voice and text aligned at the sentence level.
We've done this thanks to audio donations from radio broadcasting companies in southern Peru and also thanks to the contributions of more than 1000 volunteers.
GV: What is the ultimate goal of the project?
LC: The automatic translator is the ultimate goal.
We are currently working on the first stage, which is the voice-to-text converter. We are committed to launching a couple of videos in early 2018.
GV: What plans do you have after this?
LC: To keep going until the translator is finished.
I also hope to start building a compilation of other languages, firstly Aymara and Ashaninka.
Funding is needed for that, and I am constantly seeking funds.
To be part of the project, you can e-mail engineer Luis Camacho at qichwa @ pucp.pe.

The first, which registered 8.2 on the Richter scale, occurred on September 7 and caused close to 100 deaths, mostly in Oaxaca and Chiapas in southwestern Mexico.
The second, which occurred on September 19, killed at least 250 people and severely damaged parts of Mexico City and five states in country's center.
In the city of Oaxaca, Global Voices interviewed a man named Sergio, who is in charge of a collection center for victims.
He warned:
You can ’ t get to Juchitán unless it is with a person who knows the way, as there are crevices. Also, villagers from other communities are very angry because they have not received help from the government, so they raid supply trucks that are heading to Juchitán.
We are doing the collection here, what people bring, they can leave it with us and from here, we will take it to the most affected, unlike the governing class who only steal the donations.

Thirty-two years ago, a pair of strong earthquakes practically destroyed the city and claimed more than 12,000 lives.
Coincidentally, on September 19, 2017, an earthquake shook the city again just a few hours after the yearly commemorating drill to raises awareness.
Global Voices interviewed an office worker, who only wanted to be identified as Guillermo:
I had come to Perisur (a shopping center in the south of the capital) to buy some things and that was when it began to move.
The security guys told us that we couldn ’ t leave but when it got worse, even they ran.
There were a lot of ladies with small children and they were dragging them towards the exit.
It was horrible, I thought I was going to die when pieces of the ceiling began to fall.
On the streets of Mexico City, workers are clearing debris accompanied by hundreds of volunteers who are eager to help in any way that they can.
The armed forces have been deployed and, at least in Mexico City, they were ordered to take operational control and command in the rescue actions to avoid further casualties.
The Mexican Army and Navy have taken command in the rescue operations.

There, we talked with Margarita, who commented:
It ’ s very sad to see the people who are out here and have lost their house, but look at the building, at least they had time to leave and there are no people trapped.
A few blocks away, there are brigade members and collection centers.
I think it should be noted that buildings have changed, and while there are dozens of landslides, in most cases, people were able to escape and get to a safe place. They should show that, traditional media should broadcast photos of buildings that did not fall, instead of looking for sensationalism.

The earthquake happened at quarter past 1 in the afternoon, when most people are working in offices and shops.
The desperation to get home caused people to take to the streets, clogging roads as well as telecommunications.

This story is still developing.
Quechua-speaking fans of Peru ’ s national football team recently were able to enjoy an important World Cup qualifying match with Quechua-language commentary thanks to efforts by two radio stations sharing their broadcasts on YouTube.
Quechua might share the word for “goal ” with Spanish, but the two are distinct languages.
Quechua is the most widely spoken indigenous language in South America, including spoken by more than 3 million Peruvians.
Taking one step closer to qualifying for the World Cup Russia 2018 with a 2-1 away victory against Ecuador on September 5, 2018, Peru has only two matches left in the qualifying cycle.
Peru currently sits in 4th place that comes with an automatic berth ahead of other traditional regional powers like Argentina.
These efforts were the work of the Indigenous Audiovisual Association - Inkari and Interactiva Medios, fans could relive the match through a YouTube video summary with play-by-play in the Quechua language.

Local officials and religious leaders in southern Kyrgyzstan ritually sacrificed a sheep this week in the hope of stemming the persistent scourge of car accidents along the country ’ s highways.
Their ceremony was only partly symbolic.
An imam from the town of Toktogul, in the south of the country, said that as local administration officials handed out meat to passing drivers on the road from the capital, Bishkek, to the city of Osh, they pleaded with them to drive more carefully.
“We gave meat to everybody that passed, explaining that the food was from God.
We prayed so that everything would be well with these drivers and we urged them to pay attention on the road and to abide by the rules, ” the imam, Alipbai Boroshbayev, told EurasiaNet.org.
Boroshbayev said the cost of the exercise was covered by local community leaders and clerics.
The head of the traffic police in the Jalalabad region, Nurlan Sarkarov, said his office supported the initiative.
“Residents and the authorities decided to hold this ceremony according Islamic rites, it was all their idea. They did it on a road that we are responsible for, so the police helped them hand out food to those that stopped and also assisted in giving advice, ” Sarkarov said. Many drivers in Kyrgyzstan engage in cat-and-mouse games with traffic police, driving at excess speeds whenever they can get away with it.
Oncoming drivers regularly warn one another when approaching patrol units, so as to avoid being stopped.
The combination of speeding, bad roads and sharp bends, particularly on the main south-to-north highway, often prove fatal, however.
Sarkarov said traffic police are often limited in what they can do.
“They are places you just cannot station a patrol, like on sharp corners.
But all the rules state you cannot exceed the speed limit in those places.
Drivers ignore this, and sometimes at night they even fall asleep at the wheel, ” he said.
Traffic police say 695 people died in traffic accidents in Kyrgyzstan in the first 10 months of the year.
That represents a drop on the same period in 2016, when 771 people were killed on the roads.
Speaking about this year ’ s figures, police said more than one-third of the fatalities were the result of speeding.

"A Short History of Japanese Horror" takes a look at horror in Japanese culture, from the genre's roots in folk stories and Kabuki plays throughout the ages.
The video covers many Japanese horror classics, including "Kaidan" and "Onibaba" from Japan's Golden Age of cinema in the 1950s and 1960s to more contemporary landmark horror films such as "Tetsuo: the Iron Man" and "Ringu".
If you want to learn more, "So You Want to Read Japanese Horror: Here ’ s Where to Start" by Feliza Casano for Unbound Worlds, a website focused on literary coverage of science fiction and fantasy, is also a good place to start.

Dear Friends,
At our recent Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka, we asked members of our community what motivates them to participate in Global Voices.
Among values like understanding, diversity, acceptance, fairness, respect, inclusiveness and curiosity, one that stood out for us was messiness.
The messiness of negotiating difference, of communicating across national borders and cultural and language barriers, the messiness of creativity, the messiness that comes with any situation or relationship worth fighting for.
At Global Voices, some 1,200 of us live and work in over 170 countries around the world.
Donations to our organisation help this worldwide community report stories that forge deep connections across cultures, languages and differences of opinion — work that's urgent as we seek to understand how to live harmoniously in a difficult global environment.
As 2017 draws to a close, please make a donation to help us continue our work.
Thank you for your support, and wishing you a 2018 filled with joy and peace!

Thirteen Nigerians kidnapped by Boko Haram, a jihadist militant organization in Nigeria, regained their freedom on Saturday, February 10, 2018.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) noted in a statement that they "facilitated the handover" from Boko Haram to the Nigerian military of "10 women police officers and three university professors":
This operation in north-east Nigeria, with the ICRC acting as a neutral intermediary, was carried out at the request of the parties to the ongoing armed conflict... The ICRC was not involved in any negotiations that led to the handover of the 13 people.
The armed opposition handed the 13 people over to ICRC representatives who transported them to Nigerian authorities.
This action was similar to what the ICRC did in October 2016 and May 2017, when we transported the release of "Chibok girls" to Nigerian officials.
Ten female police officers were kidnapped by Boko Haram in June 2017 after militants allegedly ambushed a convoy of security personnel in the north-eastern city of Damboa, Borno State. They later released a video in which they described the police officers as their "slaves".
Boko Haram has been responsible for thousands of deaths including suicide bombings and violent, militant attacks in north-east Nigeria, northern Cameroon, and Niger.
The kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in 2014 by Boko Haram in Chibok, north-east Nigeria led to the global hashtag # BringBackOurGirls which later morphed into the "Bring Back Our Girls" movement.
Twitter user Jeff Okoroafor, a Nigerian citizen, thanked the Bring Back Our Girls Nigeria (BBOG) for their persistent advocacy which has kept the abduction of Nigerian citizens at the forefront:
I want to personally and specially THANK ALL members of @ BBOG _ Nigeria for their perseverance - keeping the issue of the # UniMaidLecturers & # LASSAWomen in the front burner all this while.
Well done fellow compatriots. Our dear leader and heroine, @ obyezeks GOD bless you ma'am. — Jeff Okoroafor (@ JeffOkoroafor) February 10, 2018
Vending machines in Honmachi entertainment district, Tsuruga, Japan.

Japanese vending machines have long been famous for selling the most curious things, like flowers, umbrellas, and ties.
But even with one vending machine for every 23 people and annual sales that exceed $60 billion, one can still be surprised at what comes out of their take-out port.
User senegirl on Japanese curation site Naver Matome tells the story of three unique food vending machines found in three separate cities that have captived Twitter.
A first in Japan?
Seems that way... It's a fresh-baked pizza vending Machine! (ha ha) I bet there's an old guy inside making them.
In the city of Hiroshima, residents have been abuzz over the appearance of a pizza vending machine located near local hangout TSUTAYA, part of a national chain of bookstores in Japan.
The vending machine serves up two kinds of pizza: margherita (basil, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce) for about US $10 and four-cheese for about US $13 with a cooking time of just three minutes.
TSUTAYA's parent company, which is behind the vending machines, hopes to eventually have other such machines at bookstores across Japan.
In the meantime, locals are pleasantly surprised by just how tasty machine-baked pizza can be.
The first of its kind in Japan!
A fresh baked pizza vending machine. (^ ^) It's near my job so I thought I'd go and try it. Here it is with my Lemonsco.
I didn't have time to get it, but next time I'll give it a go! (* '▽' *)
Meanwhile, in Inashiki, a city located in the Ibaraki prefecture, about an hour by train northeast of Tokyo, one restaurant was found to have fully-functioning antique vending machines from the 1960s.
Along side the national highway at an old auto stop stands an old, nostalgic vending machine where you can buy bento boxes. For 300 yen (US $3.00), you can purchase a bento made by nearby store.
There are three types to choose from: fried chicken, pork cutlet, and grilled meat, with the last being the most popular choice.
The famous grilled meat bento machine featured on TV. Finally, hidden in the city of Kagoshima, on the southwestern tip of the island of Kyushu, lies a fresh crepe vending machine.
It's located in Kagoshima's Tenmonkan shopping district, hidden near a bus stop and reportedly difficult to find.
"This crepe vending machine is in Kagoshima, but does anyone else have one in their prefecture?"
"No, we don't.
You're so lucky... "

Chabacano, one of the Philippines ’ 170 languages, is widely spoken in the southernmost city of Zamboanga and stands out as Asia's only Spanish-based creole language.
To preserve and promote Chabacano, ‘ Bien Chabacano ’ blog was created as an online resource for Filipinos and non-Filipinos interested in learning the language:
It's all about the Chabacano de Zamboanga.
Bien Chabacano is the first and only blog designed for Chabacano language enthusiasts which discusses and analyzes Chabacano word origins, Chabacano grammar, and vocabulary, and so much more!
Jerome Herrera, the ‘ Bien Chabacano ’ blog creator, explains his inspiration for initiating the project:
Bien Chabacano seeks to instill pride and improve proficiency in the Chabacano language among the young Chabacano speakers by talking about its rich and colorful history and demystifying its grammar's many intricacies and nuances.
As a creole language, Chabanaco is a mixture of Spanish and indigenous languages that evolved from a history of colonial interactions between Spain and the Philippines.
It is estimated that there are more than 600,000 Chabacano speakers in the country today.
The Philippines was a colony of Spain for more than three centuries from 1565 to 1898. But unlike other former colonies of Spain, the Spanish language was not taught in the Philippines.
Instead, Spanish friars and officials introduced Christianity and ruled the country by studying the Phillippines' indigenous languages. Spain subjugated the entire Philippine archipelago but encountered fierce resistance among some indigenous groups.
In the southern island of Mindanao which used to have a Muslim-majority population, Spanish troops established a garrison in nearby Zamboanga that was subsequently used as a base to attack Mindanao's Muslim settlements.
However, Spain never completely established control over Mindanao throughout its colonial occupation of the Philippines.
The city of Zamboanga health office featuring its slogan: "Nuestro deseo un ciudad sin enfermedad" (Our desire is a city free of illnesses). Photo and caption from Bien Chabacano, used with permission. Professor John M. Lipski of Pennsylvania State University in the United States studied the colorful history of Chabacano and its origins in Zamboanga:
Chabacano is the product of a rich cross-fertilization that could only have occurred in a region in which both great linguistic diversity and considerable overlapping areal features predominated.
Chabacano is a manifestation of linguistic and cultural resilience, a language which continues to grow in number of speakers and sociopolitical impact.
The blog ‘ Bien Chabacano ’ teaches readers basic words and phrases in Chabacano.
It features popular songs and short stories, and even a Chabacano translation of the Little Prince book. Here is the Chabacano translation of the first paragraph of the Little Prince. Notice its similarity with the Spanish language:
Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book called True Stories from Nature about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
Here is a copy of the drawing.
Image of a Zamboanga City bookstore advert written in Chabacano which roughly translates to: "The perfect place for you is appearing soon."
Photo and caption from Bien Chabacano, used with permission.
The blog directs readers to websites and social media pages where Chabacano is being used such as radio programs, television news reports, and government announcements.
The blog provides a brief background on the history of Chabacano, its different accents across the Zamboanga province, and the impact of migration and a modernizing economy on its development.
It also laments a lack of concerted efforts to promote Chabacano:
The state of Chabacano today is lamentable.
Unless more aggressive preservation efforts will be implemented, the day will come when Chabacano will only be spoken inside the home.
This prediction is bleak but it is not without merit.
Through online platforms like ‘ Bien Chabacano ’, it is hoped that it will spark more enthusiasm in the Philippines and inspire students and netizens to learn, embrace, and continue to develop the Chabacano language.
