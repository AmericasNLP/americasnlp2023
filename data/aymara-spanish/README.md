## Parallel data

The main source for Spanish (es) - Aymara (aym) is Global Voices, from OPUS (http://opus.nlpl.eu/GlobalVoices.php). 

We are providing the parallel data for both Spanish-Aymara and English-Aymara. Only the Spanish-Aymara is included in the main ```train.aym``` and ```train.es``` files.
